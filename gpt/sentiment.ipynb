For him  it was also about  wanting to just dissolve or mesh into the collection.\"\n",
      " Sculptures by [TGT] will be in the galleries that recently held the exhibit \"Joaquin Torres-Garcia: Constructing Abstraction With Wood.\" But they'll mingle with Menil-owned works by 20th-century artists such as Andy Warhol  Robert Rauschenberg  Jasper Johns  Cy Twombly  Bruce Nauman  Ed Ruscha  James Lee Byars and Francis Bacon.\n",

      " Because Cattelan's work often deals with Italian history and can suggest affinities with 20th-century Italian art  the exhibition also includes pieces by Lucio Fontana  Michelangelo Pistoletto  Alighiero e Boetti and Giovanni Anselmo  some of which are owned by the Menil  others of which are on loan from Houston collectors Nina and Michael Zilkha.\n",
      " In some respects mirroring the de Menils' journey from their native France to Houston  the collection they built emphasizes European art up to the first half of the 20th century and largely shifts to an American focus in the second half.

      "Text: The war in the Philippine city of Marawi saw Islamist insurgents execute civilians or use them as human shields   while military air strikes killed non - combatants and may have been used in excess   an Amnesty International report said on Friday . Damaged houses and buildings are seen in Marawi city   Philippines October 25   2017 . REUTERS / Romeo Ranoco The investigation by the rights group on the bloody five - month battle was based on interviews with 48 witnesses from September until early November and called for an independent inquiry . The conflict in Marawi   the only predominantly Muslim city in the mainly Catholic Philippines   was the country ’ s biggest and longest battle since World War Two . More than 1   100 people   mostly insurgents   were killed   including 166 soldiers and 47 civilians   according to the authorities . At least 350   000 people were displaced and large parts of Marawi have been decimated by air strikes . Witnesses described at least 10 separate incidents where at least 25 people were executed by the Muslim extremists because they were Christians . Amnesty described those as war crimes . It also said 10 hostages may have been killed in a single bombing run by the armed forces   and said an independent inquiry should include an assessment as to whether the air strikes were proportionate to the threat . “ They must initiate a prompt   effective and impartial investigation into whether its bombings of civilian neighborhoods was proportional under international humanitarian law  ” Tirana Hassan   Amnesty International ’ s crisis response director   said in a statement . “ The Philippine authorities must bring those responsible for torture and other violations to justice and ensure that the victims receive adequate reparations .”  [TGT]said the military was aware of the report and would respond in full later .  [TGT]  said troops were given strict instructions to observe and respect international humanitarian law and human rights . “ We will not tolerate and condone these abuses and will act on them  ”  he  told a regular news briefing on Friday . The 34 - page report   “ The Battle of Marawi : Death and destruction in the Philippines ”  quotes a survivor who said he was spared by rebels because he could recite the “ shahada ”  a statement of Islamic faith   but a Christian ambulance driver was shot dead because he could not do the same . Other survivors said hostages were executed or physically abused   forced into labor and used as human shields . Some hostages who escaped alleged they were detained and tortured by security forces who suspected them to be militants . Amnesty said it talked to eight men   including seven Christians   who said they were badly treated by the authorities . “ I was punched and kicked . They tied our hands and feet with electrical wire  ” the report quoted one survivor as saying . “ The military was angry because 13 of their men were killed .” Last month   U . S . Defense Secretary Jim Mattis praised the Philippine military for ending the war without a single credible human rights abuse allegation . Amnesty noted that the military was responding to concerns about looting by soldiers but “ must follow through on promises of compensation ”.\n",

      "Text: A short film shot mostly in California by Sriram Murali shows how much manmade lights affect the view of outer space . Murali is working on a follow up documentary ( http :// savingthedark . com /) on the effects of light pollution   and what we can do to fight it . Original link here : https :// vimeo . com / 178841667 ( Sriram Murali ) The United States is poised to get its first Dark Sky Reserve under the pristine nighttime skies of central Idaho . Pending approval from the International Dark - Sky Association   the designation would recognize the region ' s clear skies   virtually untouched by light pollution   as “ possessing an exceptional or distinguished quality of starry nights and nocturnal environment .” If you ' ve lived in or near cities most of your life and have never seen a truly dark sky you may not understand why anyone would bother with this . The night is dark   and dark is dark wherever you are   right ? The best way to explain what the Idaho Dark Sky Reserve backers want to preserve is to show it visually . Below are two photographs : on the left   a shot of the night skies in Washington   D . C . On the right   the sky above Idaho ' s White Cloud mountains   which would make up part of the proposed reserve . If you squint real hard you can make out one   maybe two stars in the photo on the left . On the right there are hundreds   perhaps thousands   with millions more casting their unearthly glow through the gas and dust clouds of our own Milky Way galaxy — the streak of nebulous light traversing the photo diagonally . Why can ' t you see the Milky Way from the D . C .? Light pollution : Streetlights and security lights and lit - up buildings contribute to a massive dome of purple - grey haze that washes out all but a handful of the brightest stars . The farther away you get from city centers   the more of the night sky you can see . But in densely populated areas like the East Coast   you need to travel hundreds of miles before you reach truly unpolluted skies . Because so much of what we can see from space is incredibly faint   at the edge of human perception   the effect of even a small amount of ambient light on the night sky can be dramatic . Below   for instance   is a simulation of the same slice of night sky viewed through different levels of light pollution . ( Imagery via Stellarium When light pollution is low   you can make out the structure of the Milky Way and even view some deep - space objects   like galaxies and nebulae   with the naked eye . Viewing the night sky is like looking out not just across space   but across time as well . The Andromeda Galaxy   for instance   is 2 . 5 million light - years away — the light we see from it was emitted long before the first modern humans walked on Earth . You can actually see it without a telescope   but not if you ' re anywhere near a city . Paradoxically   the darkest night skies appear filled with light . Under the right conditions   the Milky Way even appears bright enough to cast a faint shadow . Before the widespread adoption of electric lighting   these night - sky riches were accessible to just about anyone living anywhere . “ Less than 100 years ago   everyone could look up and see a spectacular starry night sky  ” the International Dark - Sky Association writes . “ Now   millions of children across the globe will never experience the Milky Way where they live .” That ' s where places like the proposed Dark Sky Reserve in Idaho come in . “ When we lose the night sky   we lose a piece of ourselves  ” said  [TGT]. “ Being able to look into the cosmos   look past the earth   look into the heavens   that is a really strong   profound experience .”  Mazzotta  ' s been working on the Dark Sky Reserve designation with central Idaho communities for two years . The reserve would encompass roughly 900   000 acres in central Idaho . Most of it is public land owned by the U . S . Forest Service . A key requirement of the designation is that communities within the reserve ' s boundaries   like Ketchum and Sun Valley   commit to minimizing their own light pollution . Most of those communities already have light pollution ordinances in place   [TGT] said   making the region an ideal location for the country ' s first Dark Sky Reserve . The communities within the reserve hope they can capitalize on the designation economically   via “ astro - tourism .” “ Most people when they come here from a place without dark skies   they look up and they ' re just like ' wow   this is phenomenal  '\"  [TGT]said .  [TGT]  points to existing dark sky festivals in places like Jasper   Canada and Lassen Volcanic National Park as potential models for what central Idaho could do . There ' s certainly a large potential market for it . Nearly 80 percent of people living in North America are unable to see the Milky Way from where they live   according to a 2016 study that mapped the extent of global light pollution . Starting with satellite measurements of ground - based light emissions   a team of earth scientists and astronomers applied a sophisticated algorithm to measure how that light bounced and refracted through the atmosphere   washing out the night sky to observers on the ground . Here   for instance   is the map of light pollution across the United States . Blacks and greys indicate pristine and near - pristine skies . Light pollution then runs up the rainbow gamut of colors   from blue to red   and finally pink and white designate extreme light pollution in places like city centers . Zooming into the East Coast   you can see that there ' s an almost unbroken swath of white and pink running from New York to D . C . From Washington   the closest truly dark skies are over 600 miles away in Algonquin Provincial Park   Ontario . By contrast   here ' s how the area of the proposed Dark Sky Reserve in Idaho looks : Long story short ? Where there ' s people   there ' s light . And where there ' s too much light   the night sky is lost to us . If you can ' t make it to central Idaho any time soon   that light pollution map is a good way to find nearby places that offer skies darker than what you ' re used to . Dark sky advocates say the experience is well worth the trip if you have to make one . “ Before we devised artificial lights and atmospheric pollution and modern forms of nocturnal entertainment we watched the stars  ” astronomer Carl Sagan wrote in his book “ Pale Blue Dot .” “ Even today the most jaded city dweller can be unexpectedly moved upon encountering a clear night sky studded with thousands of twinkling stars . When it happens to me after all these years it still takes my breath away .”\n",

      "Text: time Olympic medalist and one of the most accomplished gymnasts in U . S . history   says she was sexually abused by Dr .  [TGT]   who worked as the women ’ s gymnastics national team doctor for decades  . Raisman is the second member of the gold medal - winning 2012 Olympic women ’ s team to accuse  Nassar  of abuse . In October   her teammate McKayla Maroney tweeted that  Nassar  molested  her  for years   beginning when  she  was 13 . Raisman disclosed the abuse in an interview scheduled to air Sunday on CBS ’ 60 Minutes   as well as in her new book   Fierce . Nassar   who worked as a volunteer doctor for USA Gymnastics   is currently in jail awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to child pornography charges in Michigan . He is also named in more than 100 lawsuits filed by gymnasts and athletes he treated while working with USA Gymnastics and at Michigan State University . Those suits claim he sexually abused athletes under the guise of medical treatment .  Nassar  resigned from USA Gymnastics in the summer of 2015 . In the interview   Raisman says she spoke to FBI investigators about  Nassar  after competing at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janiero in 2016   after an investigation by the Indianapolis Star revealed that USA Gymnastics had a policy of not reporting sexual abuse reports unless they were filed by the victims or a parent . Raisman   who competed on the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams and is the nation ’ s second most decorated female Olympic gymnast   is pushing for change at USA Gymnastics   which governs the sport and oversees the selection of world and Olympic teams . “ I am angry  ” she said in the 60 Minutes interview . “ I just want to create change so [ that young girls ] never   ever have to go through this .” In a statement to the program   USA Gymnastics said it has adopted new policies that require “ mandatory reporting ” of any potential abuse . “ USA Gymnastics is very sorry that any athlete has been harmed … we want to work with Aly and all interested athletes to keep athletes safe .”\n",

      "Title: Mitch Trubisky says he 'was trying to do too much' on late interception\n",
      "Text: The folks at Soldier Field on Monday night would have talked about it for years . Bears fans watching at home would ' ve fibbed and said they were there . That ' s how special it would have been .  Mitch Trubisky  started to write  his  legend . The Bears had the ball at their 10 - yard line with 2 minutes   32 seconds remaining in a tie game . The rookie quarterback was about to engineer a winning drive against the Vikings in his NFL debut . It was going to be epic . Earlier in the night   Trubisky had completed several throws on the run   breathing life into a passing attack that was more slap than punch through the first four games with Mike Glennon at quarterback . So on first - and - 10 with the outcome undecided   Trubisky again channeled his athleticism and moxie   escaping the pocket to his right to try to make something out of a broken play . Ah   but this is the NFL   where passing windows aren ' t as open as they seem . Trubisky learned that the hard way when his pass for Zach Miller down the right sideline was undercut and intercepted by Pro Bowl safety Harrison Smith . The turnover tipped the scale away from the Bears in a 20 - 17 defeat . \" I was just trying to do too much outside of what I need to do  \" Trubisky said . \" Just know the situation . Know it ' s first down . Ultimately   Trubisky ' s debut was encouraging   although his final stat line won ' t win any beauty contests : 12 of 25 for 128 yards   a touchdown   a lost fumble and an interception . The dimension the Bears hoped he would add to the offense — the ability to move well and accurately throw on the run — was evident . But the Bears were undone by the familiar slew of self - inflicted wounds . They committed eight penalties for 55 yards . Their first four possessions ended in Vikings territory — with punts . They lost the turnover battle again   this time at minus - 2 . \" You ' ve got to ( give ) credit to them   but it was more of us shooting ourselves in the foot with penalties   stopping ourselves when we were in rhythm  \" Trubisky said . \" We ' ve just got to take that momentum and really step on the gas pedal right there .\" The Bears had a quick pass called on first - and - 10 to start their last meaningful series . But Trubisky felt uncomfortable and escaped the pocket to his right . That move   understandably   is a default mode for him   given how quickly he can outflank the defense and how accurately he can throw . Heck   that ' s how he threw his touchdown pass   although that rollout was designed .  Trubisky  threw a 20 - yard pass into the end zone   where Miller caught  it  after Vikings safety Andrew Sendejo tipped  it  . That   plus a nifty misdirection option to convert the two - point try   tied the game at 17 with 12 : 33 to go . As  Trubisky  rolled right on his interception   Miller released up the sideline . He had a step on Smith . If  Trubisky  had put more air under  it    Miller might have caught  it  with room to run . But the rookie threw a dart   and Smith ran underneath Miller into position to grab it . Just like that   the Vikings were in field - goal range at the Bears 28 . \" That was basically me trying to do too much  \"  Trubisky  said . Miller said he broke off his route when he saw  Trubisky  scrambling . \" I ' d like to get back into position where I can break that up for him  \" Miller said . \" I ' ll have to see where bodies are at on tape . But that was Mitch being a baller and trying to make a play .\" Before  Trubisky  emerged from the locker room in a blue suit with a white pocket square folded just so   he told his teammates that the loss was on him   that he needs to protect the ball better . That has been a painful truth for Bears quarterbacks through five games . \" You just feel like it was your fault  \" he said   \" and you could have done more to help your team win .\" So the first chapter of Trubisky ' s tale did not have a happy ending . The legend was left to be written another day . rcampbell @ chicagotribune . com Twitter @ Rich_Campbell\n",

That will likely change on Thursday   when House leaders plan to unveil a bill they ’ ve long promised would be the most far - reaching overhaul of the U . S . tax code in more than 30 years . The big reveal was initially pegged for Wednesday but was pushed back as Republicans struggle to put the finishing touches on an exceedingly complex piece of legislation . Its introduction will mark the start of an ambitious legislative timetable : President Trump said Tuesday he wants the House to pass its bill by Thanksgiving and that he wants the legislation on his desk by Christmas . “ There ’ s never been anything like this in the history of our country  ”  Trump  promised . “ It ’ s cuts and it ’ s relief and it ’ s also reform .” Related Story How  Trump  Is Endangering  His  Prized Tax Cuts Whether [TGT][TGT]  gets  [TGT]  wish will depend on how lawmakers   industry lobbyists   and the public receive the details of a plan hashed out in secret   many of which will involve politically difficult tradeoffs designed to keep the cost of the GOP plan under $ 1 . 5 trillion . What Republicans have publicized about their proposal to this point have been the benefits : a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from its current 35 percent   collapsing seven income tax brackets for individuals to three or four   doubling the standard deduction   and expanding the child tax credit . What comes out on Thursday will be the fine print . And despite the president ’ s bravado   Republicans on Capitol Hill recognize the steepest climb remains ahead of them . “ Make no mistake   all hell ’ s going to break loose when that House bill becomes public  ” Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana told CNN . “ It ’ s taking a big ole piece of cheesecake and putting a bunch of spinach on top and saying   ‘ You can ’ t eat the cheesecake ’ til you eat the spinach .’” The House bill will still have to survive a markup in the Ways and Means Committee next week   and Senate Republicans are working on their own proposal   though it ’ s expected to be broadly similar . Thursday ’ s announcement   however   will provide answers to several important questions that have vexed Republican legislators for months . Here are a few of the big ones : Who Will Pay More ? Despite the president ’ s apparent preference for a clean tax cut   the House Republican proposal will be a broader and more complicated shift in who owes what to the government . And that means   as GOP leaders have reluctantly acknowledged   that some people will actually see their taxes go up . “ Yes   some Americans probably will ” pay more   House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy conceded on Fox News . “ Because you know what we do ? We close the loopholes .” The nitty - gritty revealed in the GOP plan will allow news sites and think tanks to develop calculators that show exactly who wins and who loses . Politically   it could cut two ways . If those analyses show that the wealthier will pay more   the tax bill would become more attractive to some Democratic senators and make it easier for Republicans to pass . But the indications so far are that in some states   it ’ ll be the middle and upper - middle class that gets hit   either because of proposed changes to 401k retirement plans or the elimination of the federal deduction for state - and - local taxes . And if that ’ s the case   the GOP plan becomes a much tougher sell . How Do the Rich Fare ? The treatment of the wealthy has been one of the more interesting subplots of the Republican tax - reform drive   revealing both philosophical and strategic differences within the party . Led by Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady   the supply - side conservatives writing the House bill believe in lowering the top marginal tax rate to encourage investment and new hiring   and they reject Democratic arguments that the rich should pay more — no matter how popular they may be — as class warfare . If Ryan and Brady get their way   the highest income - tax bracket would go back down from 39 . 6 percent to 35 percent   where it stood during the George W . Bush administration before President Barack Obama demanded that Congress raise it on income above $ 400   000 a year . But Trump   who ran as a populist   is sensitive to attacks on the GOP plan as a giveaway to the wealthy . At his insistence   Republicans included a possible fourth bracket for the highest - earners in the framework they released last month   and Ryan has said that will probably stay in the bill . It ’ s likely to keep the top rate at 39 . 6 percent   but possibly only for income above $ 1 million or a higher threshold than it is currently . Other tax breaks benefiting the rich are likely to provoke intra - party squabbles . Trump   Ryan and most conservatives have pledged to repeal the estate tax   or “ death tax  ” as they call it   which only hits inheritances valued at more than $ 5 million . But a few GOP senators   including moderate Susan Collins of Maine   have balked at the idea   and a compromise could be in the works . As I wrote last month   the biggest political land mine for Republicans is their proposal to prohibit people from deducting their state - and - local taxes   or SALT   from their federal bill . The GOP needs the $ 1 . 2 trillion in revenue it could generate to pay for its cuts to the corporate and individual income rates   but ending the tax break would punish Americans in higher tax states like New York   New Jersey   Illinois   and California . The provision nearly took down the GOP plan already   when lawmakers from New York and New Jersey rebelled against the party budget . Their protests forced a compromise   but it ’ s unclear whether it ’ ll be enough to satisfy the concerns of enough members to ensure passage . Brady said in a radio interview on Tuesday that the tax bill would preserve a deduction for local property taxes but not for state - and - local income taxes . That solution has already cost Republicans the support of trade associations representing realtors and home builders   powerful industry lobbies who say the combined changes in the bill would depress home values . The most surprising proposal to leak out of the generally secretive GOP deliberations was the idea of taxing contributions to 401k retirement plans up - front rather than when people withdraw their funds later in life . Like the SALT proposal   this was about Republicans needing to raise revenue somewhere to pay for tax cuts elsewhere . The popular 401k plans was a curious target since they are used by middle - class as well as wealthier people   and the idea appeared to die a quick death once Trump rejected it in a tweet . But Brady soon made clear that changes to 401k plans remained under consideration — an example of minor congressional rebellion that   more than anything   underscored how desperate Republicans are to find offsets for their tax cuts . One possibility is that the bill unveiled this week will increase the cap on annual 401k contributions   which is currently $ 18   000   but lower the amount that people can set aside without paying taxes on it . Democrats are likely to hammer the proposal either way   and to set up a clear contrast with Republicans   they announced their own measure to expand — rather than limit — the tax break for retirement savings . As GOP aides quickly pointed out   however   the benefits of the Democratic plan would actually accrue mostly to wealthy people who could afford to contribute more than $ 18   000 a year to retirement accounts . How Much Is a Child Worth ? Republicans have already said they ’ ll include a proposal championed by Ivanka Trump to increase the child tax credit   which currently stands at $ 1   000 per kid for lower and middle - income families . What we don ’ t know is how high it ’ ll go . Some in the party want to double it to $ 2   000   but at a cost of $ 640 billion over 10 years   that could be too expensive for a plan that ’ s at risk of busting the budget as it is . The GOP could also choose to make a slightly smaller credit available to more people by expanding the income threshold for families .\n",

      "Text: Michigan State University ’ s athletic director announced Friday  he  is stepping down over  the scandal involving [TGT]. Mark Hollis told reporters at a press conference on campus that  he  will be “ retiring ” and  his  last day will be Jan . 31 . “ Our campus   and beyond   has been attacked by evil   an individual who broke trust and so much more  ” Hollis said   referring to [TGT] . “ As a campus community   we must do everything we can to ensure this never happens again — to make sure any sexual assault never occurs . But to do so   we must listen and learn lessons .” Hollis continued : “ Only then can we truly begin the process of healing . I have tried to do this since first learning about the abuse in September 2016 .” He called his decision to step down from his decade - long post “ not an easy decision .” “ I am not running away from anything   I am running toward something . Comfort   compassion and understanding for the survivors and our community — togetherness   time and love for my family  ” Hollis said . Hollis has been the athletic director at the scandal - plagued school since 2008 and he is a 1985 MSU alum . “ I have always been a Spartan   and always will be . It ’ s been an absolute honor to guide the Athletic Department for the last decade .” His announcement comes after  Nassar   a former USA Gymnastics doctor who was on the faculty at MSU    was handed a prison sentence of up to 175 years Wednesday after more than 150 women accused  him  of years - long sexual abuse . Hollis said that in his retirement   he will “ fully cooperate ” with the Michigan attorney general ’ s plan to investigate MSU ’ s role in [TGT] ’ s widespread sex abuse and the investigation of the NCAA   “ and any other investigations .” “ As a university   we must focus on the healing of the survivors and the entire community  ” Hollis said . Earlier this week   the NCAA said it was launching an investigation into how MSU handled the allegations against the twisted physician . Just hours after [TGT] ’ s sentencing Wednesday   MSU president Lou Anna Simon resigned . “ As tragedies are politicized   blame is inevitable . As president   it is only natural that I am the focus of this anger  ” Simon said in a statement .\n",

      "Text: Hurricane Maria has devastated Puerto Rico and upended the lives of millions of Americans . It ' s also left billions of dollars in damage that will wreak havoc on the island ' s economy   according to initial estimates . AIR Worldwide   which calculates the financial toll of natural disasters   predicts that losses in the Caribbean covered by insurance will be between $ 40 billion and $ 85 billion . More than 85 % of those losses are in Puerto Rico   the firm said . That number doesn ' t include damage to property that isn ' t insured   and excludes flood damage covered by the National Flood Insurance Program . Puerto Rico was in an economic crisis before it was slammed by Maria as a Category 4 storm . The island   which remains almost entirely without electricity   is already in the midst of an 11 - year recession . It filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U . S . history back in May . Related : Puerto Rico : 11 years in recession and now no electricity Estimates from [TGT]were slightly more conservative .  [TGT]expects that Puerto Rico will face $ 30 billion in total damages -- $ 20 billion in physical damages ( both insured and uninsured ) and $ 10 billion in lost economic productivity . But even that level of damage would take a massive toll on Puerto Rico ' s $ 103 billion economy   since it represents roughly 30 % of the territory ' s GDP . The longer Puerto Rico is without power   the worse the situation will be    [TGT]said . \" If it takes six months to get the grid back online   you ' re getting more economic impact than physical impact  \"  [TGT]said .  [TGT]  current model assumes that it will take three months for 90 % of Puerto Rico to have electricity restored . Related : Hurricanes Irma and Harvey have racked up billions in damages .  [TGT]said  [TGT]  ' [TGT] also concerned that people will decide to flee Puerto Rico permanently . \" A lot of people have family here on the mainland  \"  he  said . \" It ' s almost like [ Hurricane ] Katrina in New Orleans   where a lot of people left and didn ' t come back . It really guts your economy   because a lot of people who leave are your middle class and your professionals .\" The dire situation comes as Florida   Georgia and Texas continue to recover from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma . AIR Worldwide put insured losses for Hurricane Irma between $ 32 billion and $ 50 billion in both the U .  S  . and the Caribbean . The firm predicted that insured losses will exceed $ 10 billion for Hurricane Harvey . Moody '  s  Analytics said it anticipates that total damage from the two storms will exceed $ 150 billion . But economists expect the U . S . areas affected by Harvey and Irma will recover much faster . Texas has the nation ' s second largest economy   and economic output reached $ 1 . 7 trillion at the end of 2016 . Florida   the country ' s fourth largest economy   had a 2016 GDP of $ 947 billion .\n",

      "Title: The Heir Behind One of World's Leading Furniture Companies Talks Access to Luxury Gen Y\n",
      "Text: Pasquale Junior Natuzzi   son of Natuzzi ’ s founding CEO Pasquale Natuzzi – is heir to the thrown of one of world ’ s most recognized furniture brands   which net sales over the year 2016 exceeded the $ 500 million mark . The 28 - year - old - who describes himself as a contemporary nomad due to his hectic traveling schedule between hometown Puglia   Milan   the US and Asia – has acted as the company ’ s Chief Marketing & Communication Officer as of July 2017 . Pasquale Junior is currently on a mission carrying the Natuzzi brand into the world of the next generation of consumers via virtual reality initiatives   collaborations with names from the worlds of pop culture and fashion   plus a more accessible alternative to luxury . ‘ I believe that outside of our industry   in fashion for example   many companies have warmed up to the concept of targeting millennials . Within the design - and - furniture sector that ’ s not the case   except for maybe Ikea  ’ Pasquale Junior says when we meet inside the Natuzzi store on Milan ’ s Via Durini 24 . Dressed in his signature style ( i . e . a tailored suit with wide lapels and cropped pant ) the Natuzzi heir adds   ‘ Most furniture companies think just about luxury   big contracts and a starchitect collaboration from time to time . Many people who belong to my generation of under 30 - year - olds possess the type of dynamism which sees them changing house on a regular basis   plus they live in smaller spaces which they may need to share with others . Thus a brand   for those people   should be omnipresent . In the sense that   you need to create pieces that one can easily take with itself when relocating . This same audience also cares about sustainability and innovation . In our current landscape luxury isn ’ t accessible - you must find a way to reach luxury   luxury doesn ’ t come to you .’ The Chief Marketing & Communication officer looks at street art collaborations   exhibitions   event sponsorship and contests involving young talent   as ways to target an audience which   he describes as one that   ‘ is on Instagram 24 / 7 .’ As far as celebrity marketing as a mode to lure gen Y and Z consumers is concerned   the Puglia native appears to be more or less on the fence . ‘ I believe nowadays sharing the stories of people who aren ’ t necessarily ( social media ) famous but have a one of a kind story to tell   is far more interesting than reaching out to a random celebrity that partners with a handful of other brands as well . At the same time   if I would work with a Hollywood celebrity   it wouldn ’ t be just because they ’ re Hollywood   but because they ’ re actual creatives .  [TGT]. I could almost kill  myself  when I saw that  [TGT]  designed a bag in collaboration with Ikea - I was walking around with that idea for a long time . I ’ ve followed  Virgil  for a while and admire  him  as a DJ   designer and creative director – so it ’ s not just about  his  celebrity power . The same thing goes for Pharrell  ’ Pasquale Junior shares regarding his take on celebrity capsule collections in partnership with Natuzzi . It ’ s since 2011 that the Natuzzi offspring has entered the company founded by his father in 1959 . ‘ The truth of the matter is that my father raised me asking the question “ What do you want to do when you grow up ?” every day of my life   and I would answer “ Become President of Natuzzi .” I ’ ve studied the company since the age of three   so it would be a great loss for me to not invest in it and allow for it to further grow .’ Speaking of dad   co - existing inside the company with Pasquale Senior   hasn ’ t always been easy   according to Junior . ‘ It ’ s not easy working with my father on a daily basis . He ’ s tough and has a strong presence inside the company . However   it ’ s getting easier to convince him in terms of projects I suggest . In the past I remember we ’ d engage in these wars of several months before I ’ d get anything done . Nowadays it ’ s become easier to convince him   plus we both understand what our territory is : he ’ s the CEO so he looks after numbers   business plans   strategies etc . I do branding and focus on improving the customer experience .’ Upcoming Natuzzi projects include a collaborative effort between Natuzzi and a well - known Italian fashion designer   a move towards virtual reality   and the unveiling of a new icon during Milan ’ s Design Week . ‘ It ’ s a chameleon - like object that can be placed anywhere – interior   exterior   loft   hotel   small apartment   you name it . We ’ ve never done anything similar before   and it promises to become very iconic . It ’ s a type of object I personally haven ’ t seen before  ’ Pasquale Junior hints   without disclosing further information . As far as virtual reality is concerned   Natuzzi shall implement its latest addition shortly . About the VR development   the Natuzzi Chief Marketing & Communication Officer says   ‘ With our online 3D configurator you ’ ll be able to customize a product of interest in high definition - so you ’ ll be able to see every detail . You subsequently schedule an appointment at a nearby Natuzzi store   after sending in four pictures of the space in which you ’ d like to place the desired object . During the store visit   you ’ ll sit down with VR glasses on   and we ’ ll show you what the product would look like inside your living space .’\n",

But during his confirmation hearing he was unable to answer a series of questioned posed by Sen . [TGT]   R - La . [TGT]   interviewed by New Orleans TV station WWL   said Petersen   a graduate of the University of Virginia Law School   should not have been nominated for the influential position in the first place : \" Just because you ' ve seen ' My Cousin Vinny ' doesn ' t qualify you to be a federal judge  \"  Kennedy  said . \" And  he  has no litigation experience .

      "Text: A new audit about a Pentagon agency losing hundreds of millions of dollars is reported by Politico as an “ exclusive .” While that ’ s technically correct   a government agency losing or wasting or misplacing millions   billions and even trillions of dollars ( this is not hyperbole   folks ) is nothing new . Politico ’ s report is a reminder of what bloated   unaccountable government gets you . “ Ernst & Young found that the Defense Logistics Agency failed to properly document more than $ 800 million in construction projects   just one of a series of examples where it lacks a paper trail for millions of dollars in property and equipment  ” Politico reported . “ Across the board   its financial management is so weak that its leaders and oversight bodies have no reliable way to track the huge sums it ’ s responsible for   the firm warned in its initial audit of the massive Pentagon purchasing agent .” The report describes the Defense Logistics Agency ( DLA ) as the “ Walmart ” of the military   an entity with 25   000 employees who provide “ everything from poultry to pharmaceuticals   precious metals and aircraft parts .” The problem is   we don ’ t know where their money goes . The report reveals issues ranging from “ misstatements ” in the agency ’ s books   lack of documentation about projects that are in motion   to no documentation at all for $ 384 million in spending . What ’ s even more shocking is the blase response from the agency itself . When contacted by Politico   the agency wasn ’ t surprised by the conclusion   and insisted it “ will overcome its many hurdles to ultimately get a clean audit .” ” ‘ The initial audit has provided us with a valuable independent view of our current financial operations  ’ Army Lt . Gen . Darrell Williams   the agency ’ s director   wrote in response to Ernst & Young ’ s findings . ‘ We are committed to resolving the material weaknesses and strengthening internal controls around DLA ’ s operations .’ “ Wow   while the DLA may treat our money like water   it sure has refined the use of euphemisms . Can you imagine if you were the accountant for a small firm and you explained the $ 100   000 missing from the books as a “ weakness ” in your “ internal controls  ” and expected to get away with it ? But this disaster isn ’ t unique . The corruption we ’ ve watched unfold over the FISA ( Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ) warrant scandal presents another side of the same coin : a federal bureaucracy that has grown so massive it “ forgets ” who it is answerable to and begins to see itself as the living entity to be served . Bureaucrats in the information business flout the law   as though they ’ re above it . While those in charge of our money use it like a never - ending water stream   that is unending and belongs to them . Consider this from The Washington Post in April 2014 : “ The State Department ’ s inspector general has warned the department that $ 6 billion in contracting money over the past six years cannot be properly accounted for and cited ‘ significant financial risk and … a lack of internal control .’ “ A litany of problems were documented by WND in 2015   indicating a whopping $ 8 . 5 trillion that was unaccounted for by the military since 1996 . WND reported some of the spending and accounting problems uncovered at the Pentagon including : • Pentagon Spends $ 1 Billion Destroying $ 16 Billion of Ammo . • $ 300 Million a Year Unaccounted for in Afghanistan . • $ 1 Billion Paid for Loose Bolts and Damaged Aircraft . • $ 700 Million for Afghan Gem Cutters . ( You know   to reduce Afghani unemployment ). And this from Forbes in December 2017 : “ On July 26   2016   the Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) issued a report ‘ Army General Fund Adjustments Not Adequately Documented or Supported .’ The report indicates that for fiscal year 2015 the Army failed to provide adequate support for $ 6 . 5 trillion in journal voucher adjustments .” These details could give you the idea that funny business with your tax dollars is the exclusive purview of the Pentagon . While the military gets its share of scrutiny because of the budget   this is a government - wide issue . Our problem is based in financial chaos fostered by absurd decision - making and bad management at every agency and throughout our massive   unaccountable bureaucracy . Case in point : The New York Times reported this past Tuesday that FEMA paid $ 156 million to an Atlanta entrepreneur to provide 30 million meals to the people of Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria . The Times reported that  [TGT]had no experience in large - scale disaster relief .  [TGT]  described  herself  in an interview as a government contractor — ‘ almost like a broker  ’  she  said — who does not keep employees or specialize in any field but is able to procure subcontracted work as needed   and get a cut of the money along the way .  She  claims a fashion line and has several self - published books   and describes  herself  on Twitter as ‘ A Diva   Mogul   Author   Idealist with scars to prove it  ’ ” The Times reported . FEMA finally cancelled the contract after only 50   000 of the 30 million required meals were delivered . Ms .  [TGT]is disputing the termination and seeking $ 70 million in compensation . This is at least the sixth government contract awarded to Ms .  Brown  that had to be cancelled   according to The Times . When the government views the citizen as the servant   we get weaponized law enforcement agencies to be used against us   and law - breaking agency bureaucrats and politicians who see our democracy as an inconvenience to be subverted . The contempt that allows this corruption to grow also feeds a sloppy carelessness with our money . President Trump has pledged to deal with waste and mismanagement . He ’ s no doubt realizing our problems are not symptoms of incompetence alone   but a reflection of a dangerous contempt for the people and the republic itself .

      "Text: Montana will sign contracts only with internet service providers that honor “ net neutrality ” firms    [TGT]said on Monday   the latest effort by a state to undermine a Federal Communications Commission order rolling back rules introduced in 2015 .  [TGT]signed an executive order requiring state contract recipients to adhere to so - called net neutrality   which barred internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic or offering paid fast lanes   also known as paid prioritization . The Republican - majority FCC voted in December along party lines to reverse the 2015 rules . The new rules will not take effect for at least three months   the FCC has said . A spokeswoman for the FCC declined to comment on the decision by [TGT] Democrat . “ There has been a lot of talk around the country about how to respond to the recent decision by Federal Communications Commission to repeal net neutrality rules   which keep the internet free and open . It ’ s time to actually do something about it  ” [TGT] said in a statement . “ This is a simple step states can take to preserve and protect net neutrality . We can ’ t wait for folks in Washington DC to come to their senses and reinstate these rules .” Other states are considering similar efforts . The FCC order in December said it would block state and local rules that “ could impose far greater burdens than the federal regulatory regime .” Last week   a group of 21 U . S . state attorneys general and the District of Columbia   filed legal papers to challenge the FCC ’ s decision to do away with net neutrality while Democrats said they needed just one more vote in the Senate to repeal the FCC ruling . Republicans control both chambers of Congress   so even if Democrats could win a Senate majority   a repeal would also require winning a vote in the House of Representatives and would then still be subject to a likely veto by President Donald Trump . Trump   a Republican   backed the FCC action and overturning a presidential veto requires a two - thirds vote in both chambers . The FCC vote handed AT & T Inc   Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc power over what content consumers can access on the internet . Companies including Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc said they would support a legal challenge through an industry group .\n",

Wray told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the bureau had completed a background report on then - staff secretary Rob Porter last July and closed out the case entirely last month . Wray ’ s account is at odds with White House claims that the investigation required for Porter ’ s security clearance was “ ongoing ” until he left his job last week   after his two ex - wives publicly alleged physical and emotional abuse . The latest bout of turbulence is exacerbated by the administration ’ s reputation   earned over 13 chaotic months   for flouting institutional norms and misrepresenting facts to the public — a culture set by the president himself . The public relations fallout is further compounded by Trump ’ s own history of alleged sexual assault and his seeming reluctance to publicly condemn violence against women and give voice to the national # MeToo reckoning . The president has said little publicly about the Porter issue other than to praise the former aide for doing “ a very good job .” But he has privately expressed frustration with the week - long fallout   peppering advisers and confidants with questions about the media coverage and how the controversy is playing for him personally . FBI Director Christopher A . Wray said Feb . 13 the FBI had submitted a partial report on former White House aide Rob Porter ’ s background check in March 2017 and a full investigation in late July to the White House . ( Reuters ) The Porter drama has become all - consuming   creating an atmosphere of chaos and infighting reminiscent of the “ Game of Thrones ” stage early in Trump ’ s presidency — and distracting from the administration ’ s budget and infrastructure agenda . Many aides blame Kelly Inside the West Wing   a growing number of aides blamed Trump ’ s second White House chief of staff   John F . Kelly   for the bungled handling of the allegations against Porter . Trump in recent days has begun musing about possible replacements   according to people with knowledge of the conversations . [ FBI director rebuts White House account of handling of ex - aide ’ s security clearance ] Asked by a reporter to assess Kelly ’ s standing with Trump after a week of troubling revelations   White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that “ the president has confidence in his chief of staff .” But Kelly does not enjoy the confidence of an increasing number of his subordinates   some of whom said they believe that the retired four - star Marine Corps general has misled them . Kelly is “ a big fat liar  ” said one White House official   who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share a candid opinion . “ To put it in terms the general would understand   his handling of the Porter scandal amounts to dereliction of duty .” This portrait of the West Wing in turmoil is based on interviews with more than a dozen top White House officials and outside advisers and confidants   most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution . White House chief of staff John F . Kelly is under fire   even from some West Wing colleagues . ( Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post ) Kelly ’ s attempts at explaining his role   according to some aides   have included telling senior staff members last Friday to communicate a version of events many believed to be false   as well as telling at least one confidant that he has “ a good bulls --- detector ” and had long detected troubling characteristics in  Porter  . But Kelly initially defended  Porter  last week as “ a man of true integrity and honor .” And in recent weeks   Kelly was even considering giving  Porter  an expanded role in policy development   a potential promotion first reported by CNN . [ House Oversight is investigating the White House ’ s handling of  Rob Porter    Gowdy says ] “ Credibility is the coin of the realm for any White House chief of staff   and it ’ s especially important in a White House where truth was the first casualty and credibility has been the second  ” said Chris Whipple   who wrote a book about chiefs of staff . The internal animus is not limited to Kelly . White House counsel Donald McGahn and deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin are also facing scrutiny over how Porter managed to work at the White House — and hold an interim security clearance — for more than a year despite the allegations of abuse during his two marriages . Wray disputes account On Tuesday   Wray contradicted the White House ’ s account of when the bureau informed officials about the status of Porter ’ s security clearance investigation . White House officials had said that they were first contacted last summer by the FBI about Porter ’ s clearance   and that the investigation as of last week was “ ongoing ” and had not been completed . But Wray   testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee   said that the FBI submitted a partial report on Porter ’ s clearance last March and that the investigation was completed last July . Soon after   he added   the FBI received a request for a follow - up   which the bureau completed and provided last November . The FBI closed the file in January   and when it received additional information this month   “ we passed it on as well  ” Wray said . [‘ Very turbulent ’: Trump and White House consumed with turmoil amid abuse allegations ] At the White House   Sanders sought to square the conflicting timelines   arguing that even after the FBI closed its investigation   the presidential personnel office was still reviewing Porter ’ s case when he resigned last week . “ Clearly things happened after the FBI delivered this information to the White House that resulted in Porter ’ s case just pending for an extended period of time in the personnel office  ” said Ron Klain   a senior White House aide in the last two Democratic administrations . “ It was a deliberate decision to let him stay at the White House with this hanging over his head .” The fallout has left Kelly with diminished internal support and spawned intensified threats from those who hope to use the controversy to force him from his job . Several Kelly antagonists have sought to fan speculation that his position may be in imminent danger   noting that Trump has been seeking counsel from friends about who he might bring on as a new chief of staff . The president has floated replacing Kelly with either Gary Cohn   the director of the National Economic Council   or House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R - Calif .) — though Trump has often sounded out friends about personnel changes that he ultimately does not make . Nonetheless   one foe described Kelly as “ well done  ” while another said he was in “ big league ” trouble . Anthony Scaramucci   who served as White House communications director for 10 days last summer until Kelly fired him   tweeted   “ Kelly must resign .” He continued : “ Domestic abuse is a red line . Covering up for it is indefensible .” White House infighting Some White House officials   who until recently spoke of Kelly with reverence   have found ways to distance themselves from their boss   including by refusing to personally vouch for his credibility . For the past two days   Sanders has acknowledged that the White House could have handled the  Porter  situation better   a sentiment first offered last week by her deputy   Raj Shah   and echoed by Vice President Pence . But Kelly   in comments to the Wall Street Journal on Monday   said   “ It was all done right .” Some of Kelly ’ s colleagues offered a more innocuous explanation for his missteps ; one senior White House official suggested that he may simply have been “ forgetful or inartful  ” rather than deliberately mendacious . [ Perspective : Sarah Huckabee Sanders is at her worst when she ’ s talking about respect for women ] On Tuesday   Sanders parried a number of sharp questions from reporters   offering only vague responses . She said at one point that her answers could only be as complete as the information she had been provided by her superiors — remarks widely interpreted as an attempt to distance herself from Kelly . “ Obviously the press team ’ s not going to be as read - in   maybe   as some other elements at a given moment on a variety of topics  ” Sanders said . “ But we relay the best and most accurate information that we have   and we get those from those individuals .” Inside the building   officials privately griped that Kelly and McGahn could have better managed the crisis by admitting mistakes   promising to overhaul the security clearance process and protecting the president . Instead   these people said   Kelly seemed to shirk blame   grumbling to at least one confidant that the communications office should be held partly responsible . In internal conversations   Kelly sounded defensive and complained that the media was overhyping the story   according to a senior White House official who spoke with him . But not all of Kelly ’ s team shared his view . During Wray ’ s testimony   another White House aide texted a Washington Post reporter   describing the moment as “ a killer .” When asked if Kelly could have been more transparent or truthful   that official wrote : “ In this White House   it ’ s simply not in our DNA . Truthful and transparent is great   but we don ’ t even have a coherent strategy to obfuscate .” Several White House aides described themselves as initially caught off guard by the allegations against  Porter    a Rhodes scholar with two degrees from Harvard who had established  himself  as a professional and competent force inside the West Wing . But as photos emerged showing  his  first ex - wife with a black eye — and as they listened to  his  explanation   which some found implausible — some officials said they became convinced that the two women were telling the truth .

The media noticed that women nearly went home empty handed in the night ' s biggest categories - the only exception being Alessia Cara   who won the Best New Artist award . In fact   women made up just 9 percent of the Grammys ' 899 nominees   Billboard calculated . Variety asked [TGT] about the lack of recognition . “ It has to begin with … women who have the creativity in their hearts and souls   who want to be musicians   who want to be engineers   producers   and want to be part of the industry on the executive level … [ They need ] to step up because I think they would be welcome .

      "Text: It ’ s been proven that whatever the KarJenners touch turns to sold . And there is one lady behind - the - scenes that keeps it all on track : momager extraordinaire  Kris Jenner  . The Jenner Communications CEO confirmed to CNBC that her daughter Kylie Jenner ’ s cosmetics company generated $ 420 million in revenue in just its first 18 months of operation . ( According to WWD   if those numbers continue   Kylie is projected to be a billionaire by the time she ’ s 25 .) “ The goal in the future is to just build the whole infrastructure   and figure out what a retail model might look like that could take it globally  ” Kris told CNBC ’ s Courtney Reagan Tuesday . “ She ’ s just scratched the surface and there is so much more to do with the brand .”  Jenner  adds that Kylie Cosmetics is completely self - funded by the 20 - year - old star ( who is expecting  her  first child with boyfriend Travis Scott )  and there are currently no equity partners . “ Right now she ’ s super smart about keeping it all in the business  ” Kris said . “  She  owns it 100 percent herself   and  she  doesn ’ t have any investors . It makes for a wonderful opportunity to expand .” When asked if cosmetic giants like Estée Lauder and L ’ Oréal have expressed interest in the brand   Kris maintain that attaching Kylie Cosmetics to a bigger brand would be “ really advantageous ” for the future of the company . “ We ’ ve talked to a few people   and certainly there is interest   but we ’ ll see what happens  ” she said . Regardless of any impending offers – and the impending new arrival on the way – [TGT] says that [TGT] thinks [TGT] daughter will retain [TGT] laser focus on the success of the brand . “ I don ’ t think she sees herself stepping away from this brand for many years  ” Kris said   adding   “ She ’ s doing this because it ’ s really her passion . It ’ s so authentic to who she is   because she ’ s been wanting to do this since she was a little girl . To see her have this kind of success with something she really loves has been really great . ” Kris continued to make her press rounds in NYC   attending WWD CEO Summit where she spoke on a panel moderated by designer Tommy Hilfiger about the Kardashian - Jenner retail empire . She opened up about how she helped her daughter launch Kylie Cosmetics and the speed bumps they faced in the beginning . “ It was always Kylie ’ s dream to have a beauty brand and makeup company . She said [ to me ]  ‘ I really want you to help me do this and figure it out .’ And we tried launching some lip kits and they sold out in minutes   if not seconds  ” she shared . “ I realized that we have a real viable business on our hands . The fulfillment center couldn ’ t really get them out fast enough and the site crashed three times . I realized we had to get a manufacturer really quickly that could handle the volume and get a fulfillment center pulled together .” Kris drove up and down the Southern California coast until she found the perfect spot . “ I was looking things up on Google and visiting fulfillment centers and looking for a manufacturer that could manufacture at those quantities  ” she shared . “ I found the manufacturer that I was really excited about and they didn ’ t have a fulfillment center . So I went to the factory and I said   ‘ What about this area over here ? Let ’ s just do it right over here .’ That was a bit of a push but I convinced them that it was a really good idea . That was amazing for us   because it made it so much easier and it kept everything really tight inside that circle . Before we knew it   [TGT] was talking to [TGT] fans and [TGT] followers and every single social media platform that [TGT] had was so receptive to this brand . And it just exploded .” Another huge milestone for Kylie Cosmetics is the brand ’ s philanthropic partnership with Smile Train   to raise funding to provide cleft lip surgeries to young children . “ [TGT] decided to name a Lip Kit Smile   and [TGT] gave all the proceeds to Smile Train   and [TGT] was able to make a million dollars . And [TGT] was 19 years old and making a difference in the world   and we flew Peru and see a surgery  ” Kris said “ And those are the things I ’ m proudest of — when they do stuff like that .” [TGT] added : “ Any time your kids do something that ’ s a success   it makes you very proud and very happy . And I think that makes me want to do it even more and work harder for the next one   the next time . – with reporting by Sharon Kanter This article originally appeared on People . com\n",

      "Text: BUENOS AIRES   Argentina ( AP ) — A U . S . aircraft searching for a missing Argentine submarine with 44 crew members spotted white flares   but they were unlikely to be from the sub lost for six days in the South Atlantic   the Argentine navy said Tuesday . The ARA San Juan carried red and green flares   but authorities would still try to identify the origin of the white signals    navy spokesman Enrique Balbi  told reporters .  He  also said a life raft that was found in the search area early Tuesday did belong to the submarine and likely fell off another vessel . \" We ' re evaluating where the flares came from . For now   based on the color   they don ' t belong to the submarine  \"  Balbi  said . \" It ' s quite common that ships pass by that area and also common that with the waves and the rocking   they can lose a raft .\" The San Juan was last heard from last Wednesday as it journeyed from the extreme southern port of Ushuaia to the coastal city of Mar del Plata . More than a dozen international vessels and aircraft have joined in a maritime search that has become a race against the clock . The sub carried enough food   oxygen and fuel for the crew to survive about 90 days on the sea ' s surface . But it had only enough oxygen to last seven days if submerged . \" In the worst - case scenario   in the critical phase   where it could not come to the surface by its own means or renew its air and oxygen   we ' d be in the sixth day of oxygen  \" [TGT] said . This undated photo provided by the Argentina Navy shows an ARA San Juan   a German - built diesel - electric vessel   near Buenos Aires   Argentina . Argentina ' s Navy said Friday   Nov . 17   2017   it has lost contact with its ARA San Juan submarine off the country ' s southern coast . ( Argentina Navy via AP ) An Argentine navy official previously said the submarine reported a battery failure last Wednesday and was returning to the Mar del Plata Navy Base when it went missing Weather conditions that have hindered the search were expected to improve   helping search teams comb a wider area   [TGT] said . The U . S . Navy has sent its Undersea Rescue Command to Argentina to support the search for the submarine . The command includes a remotely operated vehicle and vessels that are capable of rescuing people from bottomed submarines . The crew members aboard the San Juan include Argentina ' s first female submarine officer . The sub was originally scheduled to arrive Monday at the navy ' s base in Mar del Plata   about 250 miles ( 400 kilometers ) southeast of Buenos Aires . Relatives of the crew have gathered at the base to receive psychological counseling and wait for news about their loved ones . Some local residents gathered outside the base to pray Tuesday   gripping rosary beads and religious statuettes . Others hung pictures of the crew on a fence   where children from a local school had placed drawings and messages of support for the families of the missing sailors .

Hopes were buoyed after brief satellite calls were received and when sounds were detected deep in the South Atlantic . But experts later determined that neither was from the missing sub . \" We have to continue to support those that are on the missing submarine as well as the families that are here   and make sure that they know that we believe that ( the missing crew ) will be found  \" said local resident Carolina Corbalan . \" They ' re going to be here soon .\" ___ Associated Press video journalist Paul Byrne in Mar del Plata   Argentina   contributed to this report .\n",

      "Text: After a federal judge declared a mistrial in Sen . [TGT] corruption and bribery trial in November   the Department of Justice announced it would retry the New Jersey Democrat .  [TGT]has been accused of accepting a plethora of donations and gifts from a wealthy friend in exchange for political influence . Both  Menendez  and the doctor   Salomon Melgen   maintained their innocence . The Justice Department announced on Jan . 19 its intention to retry  [TGT]and Melgen . “ The conduct alleged in the indictment is serious and warrants retrial before a jury of citizens in the District of New Jersey  ” said the Justice Department . “ The decision to retry this case was made based on the facts and the law   following a careful review .” Menendez ’ s office said in a statement Friday that he “ fully intends to be vindicated – again .” “ We regret that the DOJ   after spending millions and millions of taxpayer dollars   and failing to prove a single allegation in a court of law   has decided to double down on an unjust prosecution  ” his office said .  [TGT]is up for re - election next year .  [TGT]  was selected to replace former Gov . Jon Corzine   D - N . J .  in the Senate in 2005 . Read on for a look at what  [TGT]was accused of and what happened in the first trial . What was  [TGT]accused of ? [TGT]64   accepted an abundance of campaign donations   gifts and vacations from Salomon Melgen   a Florida ophthalmologist   prosecutors alleged when  [TGT]faced trial in 2017 . In return   prosecutors claimed   [TGT] used [TGT] position to lobby on behalf of Melgen ’ s business interests . Melgen allegedly directed more than $ 750   000 in campaign contributions to entities that supported  [TGT]according to the indictment   which prosecutors said were inducements to get  Menendez  to use  his  influence on Melgen ' s behalf . Prosecutors have also accused  [TGT]of trying to hide the gifts . Melgen paid for  Menendez  and his girlfriend to stay for three nights at a Parisian hotel where rooms typically cost about $ 1   500 per night and allowed [TGT] the use of [TGT] private jet   according to prosecutors . Federal prosecutors said that  Menendez  “ sold  his  office for a lifestyle that  he  couldn ’ t afford .” The indictment also alleged that  [TGT]pressured State Department officials to give visas to three young women described as Melgen ' s girlfriends . What was [TGT] ’ s defense ? Both  Menendez  and Melgen pleaded not guilty – and  [TGT]has vehemently denied the accusations against  [TGT]  . Throughout the original trial   defense attorneys sought to prove that  [TGT]and Melgen have been friends since before the former became a senator   and the trips were nothing more than friends traveling together . Is there anything else to know about Salomon Melgen ? Melgen was convicted of 67 counts of health care fraud in April 2017 in what the Palm Beach Post called one of the biggest Medicare fraud cases in the U . S . During that case   prosecutors argued that Melgen   who was born in the Dominican Republic   robbed Medicare of as much as $ 105 million   according to the newspaper . Aside from [TGT]Melgen has given significant amounts of money to a variety of Democratic lawmakers   according to public records . How did the trial end ?

      "Text: term extension of government funding that would avert a politically embarrassing shutdown   after  [TGT]offered mixed signals on the stopgap plan .  [TGT]  complicated the talks by saying a six - year extension of funding for the Children ' s Health Insurance Program ( CHIP )  a Democratic priority   should not be included . The White House later said  [TGT]fully backed the proposal pending in the House of Representatives   which includes the insurance plan . Given opposition in both parties   it was still unclear on Thursday if Congress could head off a weekend shutdown of the federal government   which is operating on its third temporary funding extension since the 2018 fiscal year began on Oct . 1 . Negotiators have scrambled to reach a budget deal that would include Democratic efforts to protect young immigrants known as \" Dreamers  \" who were brought to the country illegally as children   and satisfy conservatives who want to raise spending for the military . Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said they were optimistic the House later on Thursday would approve funding until Feb . 16 . A procedural House vote to approve the rules for debate passed 226 - 194 . But some Republicans were not so certain the continuing resolution had enough support for approval . Republican Representative Mark Meadows   who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus   told reporters : \" I promise you that ' s not the case \" that the speaker had enough Republican votes to pass the bill . Questions about Trump ' s support arose earlier on Thursday   when he said on Twitter that \" CHIP should be part of a long term solution   not a 30 Day   or short term   extension !\" That led the White House to issue a statement saying Trump was still on board with the House proposal . Asked if Trump ' s statements were making it more likely Republicans would be blamed for a shutdown   Republican Senator Jeff Flake   a frequent Trump critic   said simply : \" Yes .\" With the threat of a shutdown looming   some senators began to discuss the possibility of short one - or two - day extensions to allow negotiations to continue without stopping government operations . \" I think some of our members would like to see us negotiate the bigger deal and do a short - term CR for a few days  \" Republican Senator John Thune said . PREPARING FOR THE WORST Some government agencies began to prepare for a possible shutdown . The U . S . Government Accountability Office sent its employees a memo on Thursday warning that regular operations would cease on Monday if a shutdown occurred . If money were to run out   many federal agencies would be shut down and workers sent home . But \" essential services \" dealing with public safety and national security would continue . McConnell said he anticipated the House would pass the temporary funding bill and the Senate would take it up after that . \" Shouldn ’ t be a difficult vote . There ’ s nothing   nothing in such a continuing resolution that my Democratic friends actually oppose  \" he said . Democrats have insisted   however   a long - term spending bill must include a measure covering the \" Dreamers  \" who were protected from deportation under former President Barack Obama ' s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program .  Trump  ordered DACA to end in March and asked Congress to come up with a legislative fix . But bipartisan congressional negotiations with the White House faltered last week   prompting Republican leaders to begin pushing for the passage of the stopgap measure . Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer criticized  Trump  for taking a trip to Pennsylvania on Thursday to campaign for a Republican House candidate rather than staying for the negotiations . He said the House bill to fund the government was “ very likely to be unacceptable to the Senate .\" Schumer said Trump ’ s changing positions on government spending and an immigration measure were impeding progress in Congress . \" The one thing standing in our way is the unrelenting flow of chaos on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue ( the White House ). It has reduced the Republicans to shambles . They don ' t know who to negotiate with  \" he said in a Senate floor speech . Republicans hold a 51 - 49 majority in the Senate and most legislation   including spending bills or an immigration deal   will require 60 votes to pass . Republican Senator Lindsey Graham   who is involved in the immigration negotiations   and conservative colleague Mike Rounds have said they will not vote for a short - term funding bill . Some Republicans have argued a shutdown would hurt military readiness by disrupting supply chains and complicating planning and contracts .\n",

      "Text: At a press conference in June   a reporter asked  [TGT]whether  he  ’ d be willing to answer questions about the Russia scandal under oath . “ One hundred percent  ” the president responded . As we discussed last week   [TGT] ’ s position on this has evolved . Asked at a press conference at Camp David whether he ’ s still committed to speaking with [TGT] hedged   refusing to answer the question directly . A few days later   at an event alongside the prime minister of Norway   [TGT] faced a similar question . The Republican ’ s response was long   meandering   and not altogether coherent   but he concluded that it “ seems unlikely ” that he ’ d answer the special counsel ’ s questions . Close video [TGT] lawyers change defense on collusion and obstruction Rachel Maddow points out that  [TGT] ’ s lawyers ’ arguments about [TGT] ’ s legal liability in the Russia scandal  have changed from denying [TGT] ’ s actions to excusing  them  as not illegal . Also noted is that Mike Pence ’ s lies about Mike Flynn need a new share tweet email save Embed Special counsel Robert S . Mueller III is seeking to question [TGT] in the coming weeks about his decisions to oust national security adviser Michael Flynn and FBI Director James B . Comey   according to two people familiar with his plans . Mueller ’ s interest in the events that led [TGT] to push out Flynn and Comey indicates that his investigation is intensifying its focus on possible efforts by the president or others to obstruct or blunt the special counsel ’ s probe . If today ’ s reporting from the Washington Post is any indication    [TGT]may need to change  [TGT]  posture once more . This dovetails with a story that ’ s been brewing of late . NBC News reported two weeks ago   for example   that the logistics and scope of an interview between the special counsel ’ s team and  [TGT]were the subject of discussion among the relevant lawyers . Bloomberg Politics reported soon after that talks between [TGT] ’ s legal team and Mueller ’ s team are “ expected to continue … despite comments from  Trump  suggesting an interview is unlikely .” With this in mind   the Post added that the president ’ s attorneys “ have crafted some negotiating terms for the president ’ s interview with Mueller ’ s team   one that could be presented to the special counsel as soon as next week   according to the two people .” As for the nature of the conversation   the Post ’ s article went on to say that [TGT]   under the current plan   would like to answer some questions in an in - person interview   while answering others in writing   which is also consistent with NBC News ’ recent reporting . ( Why the president would find it necessary to turn part of the Q & A into a take - home exam is unclear .) It ’ s the subject of interest   however   that continues to stand out : if the special counsel is focused specifically on possible obstruction of justice   it suggests the president may be facing legal jeopardy . In November   [TGT] said   “ As far as [TGT] ’ m concerned   I haven ’ t been told that we ’ re under investigation   I ’ m not under investigation .” It may be a good idea to revisit that .\n",

On trade    [TGT]  criticized the “ very one - sided and unfair ” trade relationship between the U .

[TGT]said China “ must immediately address the unfair trade practices that drive ” what  [TGT]  said is a “ shockingly ” large trade deficit   along with barriers to market access   forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft . “ But I don ’ t blame China  ”  he  said . “ After all   who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens ?” To applause    [TGT]said : “ I give China great credit .”  [TGT]  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered a blunter assessment of China ’ s trade surplus with the United States   which in October widened by 12 . 2 percent from a year earlier   to $ 26 . 6 billion . The total surplus with the United States for the first 10 months of the year was $ 223 billion . ___  [TGT]cooperates with Chinese effort to control image BEIJING — U . S .  [TGT]was a cooperative partner for Beijing ’ s sweeping efforts to control the message of  [TGT]  heavily choreographed visit to China . [TGT] and  [TGT]  Chinese counterpart   Xi Jinping   took no questions at an event Thursday billed as a news briefing   a reduction of already minimal press interaction during previous visits by American leaders . During a 2014 visit by then President Barack Obama   Xi took a symbolic single question from a reporter for a Chinese state newspaper . He brushed off an American reporter ’ s question about whether Beijing might ease restrictions on journalist visas   saying vaguely that media outlets had to obey China ’ s laws . [TGT]who has called the media the “ enemy of the American people  ” also took no questions during an event at which Chinese companies signed contracts to buy American jetliners   soybeans and other goods . [TGT] ’ s visit comes at a time when [TGT] faces uncomfortable questions at home about Russia and possible gun controls following deadly mass shootings . ___ North Korea   ever so cautiously   is going online PYONGYANG   North Korea — Ever so cautiously   North Korea is going online . Doctors can consult via live   online video conferencing   and lectures at prestigious Kim Il Sung University are streamed to faraway factories and agricultural communes . People use online dictionaries and text each other on their smart phones . In the wallets of the privileged are “ Jonsong ” or “ Narae ” cards for e - shopping and online banking . Cash registers at major department stores are plugged into the web . It ’ s just not the World Wide Web . This is all done on a tightly sealed intranet of the sort a medium - sized company might use for its employees . The free flow of information is anathema to authoritarian regimes   and with the possible exception of the African dictatorship of Eritrea   North Korea is still the least Internet - friendly country on Earth . Access to the global Internet for most is unimaginable . Hardly anyone has a personal computer or an email address that isn ’ t shared   and the price for trying to get around the government ’ s rules can be severe . But for Kim Jong Un   the country ’ s first leader to come of age with the Internet   the idea of a more wired North Korea is also attractive . It comes with the potential for great benefits to the nation from information technology — and for new forms of social and political control that promise to be more effective than anything his father and grandfather could have dreamed of . It also allows for the possibility of cyber - attacks on the West . ___ Pence   Abbott attend vigil for victims of church shooting SUTHERLAND SPRINGS   Texas — Vice President Mike Pence joined Texas Gov .

She found a Facebook page called “ Find My LV Hero ” and posted a plea . “ Looking for husband and wife who were by the VIP bleachers and helped me get out  ” wrote Gilman   of Bonney Lake   Washington . “ My wife gave the husband her shirt and the wife held it against my side to stop bleeding as they carried me through the VIP area out to the street .” Despite the scant details in Gilman ’ s post   it worked . Three days later   Gilman connected with her rescuers   Alex and Wanda Valiente   off - duty Los Angeles County sheriff ’ s deputies who were at the Oct . 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of a hotel   killing 58 people and wounding hundreds . The connection is one of about 25 made so far through the Facebook page . Nearly six weeks after the massacre   Ashton Zyer ’ s social media creation continues to generate new searches for heroes who in some cases saved lives and in others simply provided what comfort they could . ___ IS militants evacuate last stronghold in Syria to government BEIRUT — A Syrian war monitor says Islamic State militants have withdrawn from their last stronghold following a government offensive . The Britain - based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says government forces and allied troops   including Iraqi fighters   are combing Boukamal   a strategic town on the border with Iraq   on Thursday after IS militants withdrew . Syrian pro - government media say Syrian troops had clashed with remnants of IS militants in the town after they entered it late Wednesday . On Thursday   they declared the town totally free of the militants . The fall of Boukamal means remaining IS militants are currently holed up in small towns and villages along the border with Iraq and in the Syrian desert . ___ Democrats see wins as momentum for 2018 state elections Sweeping Democratic victories in Virginia and key gains in other 2017 state legislative races have lifted Democratic hopes of even bigger wins in next year ’ s midterm elections   as they seek a greater voice in how political districts will be redrawn for the decade to come . Democrats won the governors ’ offices in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday   erased a previously dominant Republican majority in the Virginia House of Delegates and won a special election that gave them control of the Washington state Senate . All told   Democrats flipped about two dozen state legislative seats around the country Tuesday and have now gained at least 30 seats previously held by Republicans since  [TGT]won election last year   reversing several years of Republican momentum . “ In general   this is a rebuke of Republican governance of states  ” said Jessica Post   executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee . She added : “ The other thing it said is we can win all across the country .” The fight for control of legislative chambers matters not only for policies on health care   taxes and education   but also because the legislature in most states determines how future congressional and state legislative districts are drawn . The next round of redistricting will take place after the 2020 Census   and both parties are focused on controlling as many states as possible by then . ___ Pomp and flattery : Asia rolls out the red carpets for Trump BEIJING — Honor guards marching in unison in colorful uniforms . Elaborate state dinners with celebrity guests . Gaggles of children   jumping and screaming along with endless praise . The first half of [TGT] ’ s whirlwind tour to Asia has been an exercise in the art of flattery   as world leaders woo the man who was introduced at the South Korean National Assembly as the “ leader of the world .” “ They are not ignorant that this is a president who is particularly responsive to flattery  ” said Lindsey Ford of the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington   who said the Chinese   in particular   would “ absolutely go over the top ” trying to stroke the president ’ s ego . The pomp and pageantry began in Japan   where  [TGT]was welcomed to the grand Akasaka Palace with a welcome ceremony that featured a maze of red carpets   an honor guard and marching band . Prime Minister Shinzo Abe   who has gone out of his way to strike up a personal friendship with  [TGT]    also treated the president to a round of golf at Japan ’ s premier course   complete with a champion golf partner and a taste of home : a hamburger lunch made with American beef . ___ Christopher Plummer to replace Kevin Spacey in Getty film LOS ANGELES — In a wholly unprecedented move   Kevin Spacey is being cut from Ridley Scott ’ s finished film “ All the Money in the World ” and replaced by Christopher Plummer just over one month before it ’ s supposed to hit theaters . People close to the production who were not authorized to speak publicly said Wednesday that Plummer is commencing reshoots immediately in the role of J . Paul Getty . All of Spacey ’ s scenes will be reshot   the people told The Associated Press . Co - stars Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams are expected to participate . Scott   who is known to be an efficient director   is intending to keep the film ’ s Dec . 22 release date . The director ’ s publicist Simon Halls confirmed the switch late Wednesday . The film was originally set to have its world premiere at the AFI Fest in Los Angeles on Nov . 16 but was pulled earlier this week amid the sexual harassment reports surrounding Spacey   who has also been fired from “ House of Cards ” and dropped by his talent agency and publicist . ___ Top moments at CMA Awards : Vegas   unity and the monologue Yes   Garth Brooks won entertainer of the year and Chris Stapleton picked up two honors   including album of the year . But the moments that truly dominated the 2017 Country Music Association Awards had less to do with winning   and more about a community banding together to heal .

      "Title: New York Times Opinion Page To Publish Letters From Trump Supporters\n",
      "Text: “ I ’ m thrilled with the progress that President Trump has made in defeating ISIS   cutting taxes for middle - class families and making court appointments  ” Emily Robertson from Austin   Texas   wrote in her letter . “ Thanks to the tax cuts   my husband and I stand to keep a much larger portion of our paychecks .” Not many of Trump ’ s supporters seem to approve of his aggressive   bully - like demeanor   though . I voted against Hillary Clinton more than I voted for  [TGT]  . That said    President Trump  has exceeded my wildest expectations . Quite a few of the letters admit that  the president  ’ s speeches and tweets are a problem   with one writer calling  him  a “ crude   rude   clueless dude .” Yet there seems to be a consensus among  Trump  supporters that the last year was defined by more than just social media . “ If it takes putting up with Mr . Trump ’ s brash ways to see things get done   that is a deal I ’ m willing to accept  ” Jason Peck of Holtsville   New York   wrote in his letter . “ To be honest   I ’ m not sure he would have accomplished what he has so far without being an unrelenting public bully .” The Times has made an effort in the last year to shed its reputation   deserved or not   for liberal elitism . Giving more voice to  Trump  fans is only the latest effort to restructure  its  opinion page . Bret Stephens   a conservative columnist   was brought aboard even though he has controversial opinions on issues such as climate change and the Middle East .\n",

      "Title: Trump Keeps Promising Action On Gun Control But Republicans Might Not Be Able To Deliver\n",
      "Text: Republicans in Congress are nowhere near coming together around any plan to address gun violence   nearly two weeks after a school shooting in Florida left 17 dead   and despite [TGT] ’ s promises to take action . Returning to Washington Monday after a week on recess   Republicans were divided on a slew of proposals [TGT] has raised   and some questioned whether any reforms are needed at all . “ I don ’ t think we need more gun control  ” Louisiana Sen . John Kennedy told reporters Monday . “ I think we need better idiot control .” Trump   who has been talking to congressional Republicans and lobbyists from the National Rifle Association in recent days   has proposed a broad range of ideas during listening sessions and in tweets   including increasing the age requirement for purchasing certain types of guns   arming some teachers   making changes to the background check system   reopening mental institutions   and banning bump stocks through the Department of Justice . The White House is scheduled to host a bipartisan group of lawmakers Wednesday to come up with a path forward on some of those ideas . “ We continue to mourn the loss of so many precious young lives  ” Trump said Monday . “ These are incredible people . I visited with a lot of them . But we ’ ll turn our grief into action .” While the media campaign from the young survivors of the Parkland shooting has kept up the pressure on lawmakers to act   many Republicans are still reluctant to push significant changes to gun policy and challenge the NRA   which has five million members — the majority of whom live in conservative districts . In a room with several Republican governors    Trump  said Monday not to worry about the influential group . \" You guys — half of you are so afraid of the NRA  ”  he  said . “ There ' s nothing to be afraid of . And you know what   if they ' re not with you   we have to fight them every once in a while . That ' s OK .\" Despite Trump ’ s lobbying and focus   several Republicans who are strong advocates of the Second Amendment aren ’ t convinced gun control measures will curb mass shootings . Some Republicans   like Arizona Sen . Jeff Flake   who is not running for reelection   are more open to gun control reforms   including raising the age for purchasing some types of guns to 21 . “ This shooting was different  ” Flake told reporters   arguing that it would be hard for Republicans to not bring legislation up for a vote . “ It was amazing to me how quickly it died down after Las Vegas   but this one   with high school kids who have been very articulate in their   you know   in their explanation of what ' s needed and social media and everything else . We seem to have crossed the Rubicon here .\" Florida Rep . Mario Díaz - Balart also took a more open position . “ I ' m willing to look at anything to keep the American people safe   but I also need to make sure that we protect individual liberties  \" he told reporters Monday . Rep . Mark Meadows   chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus   said his group plans to discuss various gun control measures   but some   such as raising the legal age of purchasing some firearms   will not be supported by the majority of the Republican party . Another measure being discussed is the so - called Fix NICS bill   which would strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System . That measure was passed by the House in December   but only after being tied to rules that would allow anyone with a concealed - carry permit to carry concealed weapons across state lines . That made the bill a nonstarter in the Senate . Meadows said at the time Speaker Paul Ryan told the Freedom Caucus there would be no other votes on Fix NICS . Now it is being floated again   but Meadows says the Freedom Caucus has objections over due process fears . Meadows said the legislation as written would allow for guns to be taken away from people who do not have proper channels to defend their mental state . The  Trump  administration   for all of the president ’ s calls to action   has not moved to rally Republicans around any specific proposals   and is yet to provide any language on exactly what they would like Congress to support .  Trump  has said several times  he  ’ d like to strengthen background checks   but the president and  his  aides have declined to say if they support universal background checks   which failed to garner enough votes in Congress in the wake of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting . And on raising the age requirements   a measure that the NRA does not support   White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday   “ it would be premature for us to weigh in . But   as I said   the president is still supportive of the concept .” Reluctant Republicans could be more willing to get behind the president once he officially backs specific proposals   said South Carolina Sen . Lindsey Graham . “ Anything the president gets behind   because he ' s a Republican president   is a game changer  ” Graham told reporters Monday . “ So if he wants to raise the age to 21   I ' m not so sure that ' s a good idea   but if he got behind it   then you ' re in the ball game .\" Without backing from Republicans in Congress   there is little that the administration can do to curb gun violence . Even on banning bump stocks — the one measure that the president has said he can do through the Department of Justice — it ’ s unclear if the department will have the authority to enforce such a ban   and there are already concerns about the legal battles it could lead to . And Trump ’ s oft mentioned idea to arm thousands of teachers or train them to conceal and carry has proven to be divisive   even among congressional Republicans . \" I think arming educators is a really bad idea  \" Maine GOP Sen . Susan Collins told reporters Monday . Because they ' re trained to teach   not to be security guards . They already have a lot on their plate   and I think it ' s a terrible idea .\" Montana Sen . Steve Daines   meanwhile   said he does support arming schools   and opposes most of the other policies his colleagues or the president have raised . He dismissed proposals such as raising the legal age limit to buy certain types of weapons as “ feel - good measures that are not going to solve the problem .” He pointed to the US Capitol as a potential model for school safety . “ Why have we not seen an active shooting in the Capitol ? You know why   because we have armed guards out front  ” Daines said . Meadows also said he is open to the idea of protecting schools by arming some teachers . “ It happens in other areas . Churches generally have concealed - carry security guards each and every Sunday . Certainly in Israel the synagogues do  ” he said . Several other Republicans simply avoided taking hard stances on any of the president ’ s ideas on gun control . Louisiana Sen . Bill Cassidy said he is “ willing to consider ” the proposal to arm teachers in schools   and Alabama Sen . Richard Shelby urged caution on that particular idea   but he did not come out against it . A Parkland student and one of the young organizers of the # NeverAgain movement for gun control that has come out of the shooting met with Democrats Monday   and tweeted that the “ uproar ” over guns is now “ undeniable .”\n",

      "Text: The U . S . Senate on Wednesday took a step toward passage of tax legislation that is a top White House priority   setting up a likely decisive vote later this week even though it was unclear if the bill has enough Republican support to become law . Congressional Republicans spent the day scrambling to reformulate their tax bill to satisfy lawmakers worried about how much it would balloon the U . S . budget deficit . On a Christmas themed stage   U . S . President Donald Trump speaks about tax reform legislation in St . Louis   Missouri   U . S . November 29   2017 . REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque Stocks rallied on optimism the tax overhaul package could pass   but obstacles remained   including attempts to address the estimated $ 1 . 4 trillion that the bill would add to the United States ’ $ 20 trillion national debt over 10 years . Lawmakers voted by a 52 - 48 margin to begin formal debate   a step that could lead on Thursday and Friday to a decisive vote on the bill   which aims to cut taxes on corporations   other businesses and a wide range of individuals and families . Republicans have a 52 - 48 majority in the 100 - member Senate   giving them enough votes to approve the bill if they can hold together . Without Democratic support   Republicans can afford to lose no more than two of their own votes . U . S . [TGT] speaks about tax reform legislation during a visit to St . Louis   Missouri   U . S . November 29   2017 . REUTERS /  Kevin Lamarque President Donald Trump in a speech in Missouri on Wednesday    implored members of  his  own party to get behind the effort   which would be  his  first significant legislative achievement since taking office in January . “ A vote to cut taxes is a vote to put America first again  ” [TGT] said   adding the bill could “ cost me a fortune ” and that [TGT] wealthy friends were not happy . “ My accountants are going crazy right now . It ’ s all right . Hey look   I am president   I don ’ t care . I don ’ t care anymore .” Slideshow ( 3 Images ) Democrats say the tax cuts are a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy at the expense of working Americans . Some Democrats have said  [TGT]  and  [TGT]  children would gain from the bill   which would repeal the estate tax on inherited wealth . Among Americans aware of the Republican tax plan   49 percent said they were opposed   up from 41 percent in October   according to a Nov . 23 - 27 Reuters / Ipsos poll released on Wednesday . The latest online poll of 1   257 adults found 29 percent supporting the plan and 22 percent saying they “ don ’ t know .” The sweeping tax package was developed over several months behind closed doors by a small group of senior congressional and [TGT] administration figures   with little input from many Republican lawmakers and no involvement from Democrats .\n",

      "Title: GOP senator: Trump has changed his mind about Russian interference\n",
      "Text: When it comes to  the Russia scandal   [TGT] and [TGT] team  have adopted a series of evolving postures . Remember when  they  used to argue – with a straight face – that literally no one from [TGT] ’ s operation was in communications with Russians during the foreign attack on the American elections ? As it turns out   Trump World doesn ’ t say this anymore . But there ’ s one aspect of the scandal on which the president has been remarkably consistent :  [TGT]has rejected the idea that Russia stole Democratic materials in the first place . Indeed   since the moment U . S . intelligence officials briefed the then - Republican candidate on this in 2016    [TGT]rejected the claim as folly   going to far as to repeatedly mock American intelligence agencies . No matter how painfully obvious the facts were to everyone on the planet    [TGT]refused to accept the most basic detail of the entire controversy . According to Sen . Lindsey Graham ( R - S . C .)  however   all of that has changed . Here ’ s the exchange  he  had yesterday with NBC News ’ Chuck Todd on “ Meet the Press .” GRAHAM : Well   the president does now finally believe that the Russians stole the emails from the DNC and hacked   and Clinton   and the Russians …. The president does believe his intel agencies . Now   it ’ s quite likely that  [TGT]and Graham   who appear to now be rather close allies   have had private conversations in which the president has said things to the senator that he hasn ’ t shared with the public . But if  [TGT]told Graham he now believes Russians stole Democratic documents   it would represent a dramatic change of heart . As recently as mid - November – not quite two months ago –  [TGT]told reporters that Vladimir Putin personally assured  him  that Russia didn ’ t meddle in the American election . “ Every time  he  sees me  he  says   ‘ I didn ’ t do that  ’ and I really believe that when  he  tells me that    he  means it  ” the American president said in reference to his Russian counterpart . It was part of a lengthy pattern in which [TGT] refused to accept U . S . intelligence agencies ’ findings . “ Nobody really knows for sure ” whether Russia intervened in the American elections   the president said in July – after intelligence professionals told him they do know for sure . But according to Lindsey Graham   sometime between mid - November and early - January   [TGT] changed his mind   and if the senator is right   the shift is a pretty important development . Indeed   Graham ’ s assertion raises some key follow - up questions for the White House : 1 . Can anyone from Trump World confirm whether Graham is correct ? If so   what finally convinced  [TGT]  to change his mind ? If  Trump  now believes Putin ’ s government stole American materials in order to influence the outcome of American elections   what does the president intend to do to punish our foreign attackers ? If  Trump  now accepts the intelligence community ’ s findings   does he have any regrets about insulting intelligence agencies for so long ? Should they expect a presidential apology ? Or is it possible Lindsey Graham is carrying water for his new pal   who ’ ll soon make the senator appear foolish by saying the opposite of what the senator claimed yesterday ?\n",

      "Title: Forget Birthers and Girthers\n",
      "Text: truth society .” Inconvenient truths are now readily labeled “ fake news  ” even when put out by “ papers of record ” like the New York Times or “ broadcasters of record ” like CNN . This is particularly convenient   of course   for those who have reason to fear truth . And hence those who have “ something to hide ” might have something to do with the spread of the “ post - truth ” phenomenon . Many who lament the “ post - truth society ” attempt to date its advent or to identify its sources with that last observation in mind – the observation that truth - fearers are apt to be “ post - truth ”- lovers . One oft - accused culprit   where sourcing ’ s concerned   is accordingly the class of people who misuse social media in pursuit of “ agendas .” Such purveyors of “ alternative facts ” are widely seen to undermine our relation to reality itself . This in turn fosters a dysfunctional version of what legal philosopher Brian Leiter has in another context labeled the “ hermeneutic of suspicion ” – a sort of news - readers ’ and - watchers ’ rendition of what once was called “ the paranoid style ” in American politics . Where dating the post - truth society ’ s advent is concerned   there are multiple milestone candidates on offer . Some will say it all started with the ravings of hate radio DJs like Rush Limbaugh or Alex Jones   or of hate television hosts like Glenn Beck or Sean Hannity . Others will point to “ conspiracy theorist ” film - makers like Michael Moore or Oliver Stone   or to “ false equivalence ” claimants like tobacco manufacturers and fossil fuel companies eager to have us all thinking “ the evidence cuts both ways ” on cigarettes ’ associations with lung cancer or carbon ’ s association with climate change . Somewhat ironically   given the “ many sides of the story ” meme just alluded to   there is much to recommend most of the milestones and source - candidates just mentioned as having helped bring - in the era of “ post - truth .” I ’ d like to suggest   however   that the “ post - truth society ” has more saliently developed in lock - step with the political career of one man   and that it ’ s no accident that both have reached final fruition at the same “ moment ” in American political history . I refer   of course   to Donald Trump – a man whose relation to financial truth should draw our attention at least as readily as do his relations to legal and political truth . That  [TGT]might be more show than substance has been widely observed since well before  [TGT]  entered the 2016 Presidential race . And this distinction of course maps onto that between fake news and real news   appearance and reality – or truth . For reasons of this sort even I have suggested that Mr .  [TGT]is a bit like an opiate   and might for this reason be labeled “ The Opioid President .” But while I continue to think this all sound as a matter of general characterization   I want here to draw attention to something much more specific – something   again   having to do with finance   not to mention our national economy . As most readers will recall   when Barack Obama was President many who disagreed with his politics sought to undermine his legal legitimacy by suggesting that he ’ d not been born in the U . S . “ Show us your birth certificate  ” these so - called “ Birthers ” demanded   and continued to demand even long after the then - President had – far too graciously – done so . Among these “ Birthers  ” of course   was Donald Trump   whose entry into the Presidential sweepstakes arguably commenced with his “ going public ” as a “ Birther .” Now   perhaps partly as “ payback ” for that sorry episode   many  [TGT]  detractors last month began calling themselves “ Girthers .” This they did in response to non - credible doctor reports to the effect that Mr .  [TGT]  weighed nearly the same as do many currently active professional sports figures of roughly the same height as  Trump  . Juxtaposed photographs of Mr .  Trump  and sundry star athletes   typically accompanied by stats and such captions as “ something doesn ’ t add up ” became something of a “ meme ” for a while on social media . I want to suggest that   how ever more plausible the skepticism of the “ Girthers ” is than was that of the “ Birthers  ” there is something far more important to be skeptical about – something that lends greater significance both to Mr . Trump ’ s still - undisclosed tax returns and to the ongoing Mueller investigation than seems to be thus far appreciated . Rather than “ Birthers ” or even “ Girthers  ” I wish to argue   we should all now be “ Worthers .”\n",

Waters told Elle magazine days after her State of the Union response that she follows Breitbart News ’ s critical reporting on her antics . According to Elle ’ s puff piece   Waters “ touched on the attacks that the Republican party and   in particular   Breitbart have launched against her — she noted that she ’ s frequently referred to as Mad Max .” “ When you make a decision   and you know that decision is controversial   you know that you ’ re going be up against people who are going to fire back at you  ” she reportedly said . “ I ’ m prepared to suffer the consequences of my actions   and I don ’ t fall backwards into this stuff .

What can we do ?” Waters also used her response to [TGT] ’ s State of the Union address last week to call for [TGT] ’ s immediate impeachment while saying  Trump  is “ a dangerous   unprincipled   divisive   and shameful racist .” ” Increasingly   millions of Americans have recognized that  [TGT]is detrimental to our nation .” We deserve better .

      "Title: China January factory growth dips to eight\n",
      "Text: Growth in China ’ s manufacturing sector slowed more than expected in January to an 8 - month low in the face of a cooling property market and tighter pollution rules that have curtailed factory output . The data   which gives global investors their first look at business conditions in China at the start of 2018   reinforced the view that the economy is beginning to gradually lose steam after growing by a better - than - expected 6 . 9 percent last year . The official Purchasing Managers ’ Index ( PMI ) released on Wednesday edged lower to 51 . 3 in January   compared with 51 . 6 in December . But it remained comfortably above the 50 - point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis . Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the headline number would ease slightly to 51 . 5 . Indexes for output   total new orders and imports all showed more moderate expansion in January compared with last month   while export orders fell marginally . The new export order index dropped to 49 . 5   2 . 4 percentage point lower than December ’ s reading . However   the overall factory reading still appeared relatively solid   marking the 19th straight month of expansion and reinforcing expectations that any slowdown in the economy would be gradual . Economists polled by Reuters are penciling in growth of 6 . 5 percent this year . [ ECILT / CN ] A separate PMI on the steel sector rose to 50 . 9 in January from 50 . 2 in December . In another sign of broader economic resilience   a sister survey showed activity in China ’ s service sector accelerated to a four - month high in January . The official non - manufacturing Purchasing Managers ’ Index ( PMI ) rose to 55 . 3 from 55 in December . The services sector accounts for over half of China ’ s economy   with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending power . A buoyant services industry is welcome news for the policymakers who are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports . TRADE RISKS Boosted by government infrastructure spending   a resilient property market and unexpected strength in exports   China ’ s manufacturing and industrial firms were a major driver behind the solid economic growth last year . But analysts say increasing trade frictions with the United States could cloud the outlook for exporters in the world ’ s second - largest economy . U . S .  [TGT]slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels last week . China is the world ’ s biggest solar panel producer . The decisions were the first of several potential tariff actions that  [TGT]may take in the coming weeks and months .  [TGT]  is also considering recommendations on import restrictions for steel and aluminum and other trade sanctions against China over its intellectual property practices . A slowing property market is also likely to dent China ’ s industrial activity this year   dampening demand for building materials from glass to steel . Property investment growth in December alone moderated to 2 . 4 percent from a year earlier   the lowest since July 2016 . Moreover   China is expected to continue a wide - ranging crackdown this year on riskier types of financing and debt . The campaign is slowly pushing up companies ’ borrowing costs and making it harder and more expensive for weaker firms to raise funds . “ Looking ahead   some of the recent weakness in manufacturing may be partially reversed in the coming months as disruptions caused by the anti - pollution campaign fade  ” Julian Evans - Pritchard   senior China Economist at Capital Economics   wrote in a research note on Wednesday . “ But any rebound is likely to prove short - lived given that the drags on economic activity from slower credit growth and the cooling property market are set to intensify this year .” China also published a composite PMI for the first time on Wednesday   covering both manufacturing and services activity in a bid to better capture overall economic trends . The composite PMI stood at 54 . 6 in January   well above the 50 - mark that separates expansion from contraction and unchanged for a third month .\n",

      "Title: Fact\n",
      "Text: President Trump announced his tax plan on Sept . 27 in Indianapolis . We fact checked his address . ( Meg Kelly / The Washington Post ) President Trump ’ s speech on the administration ’ s still - somewhat - vague tax plan   delivered in Indianapolis on Sept . 27   was filled with many of his favorite   inaccurate claims . For instance   he repeatedly says he is offering the “ largest tax cut in our country ’ s history  ” a dubious claim when properly measured as a percentage of the nation ’ s gross domestic product . Here ’ s a sampling of other inaccurate claims — and one case in which he appears to have adjusted his language because of our previous fact checks . “ To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer   we are finally ending the crushing   the horrible   the unfair estate tax   or as it is often referred to   the death tax .” The president ’ s suggestion that “ millions ” of small businesses and farms are affected by the estate tax is absurd . According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center   only about 5   500 estates in 2017 — out of nearly 3 million estates — would have to pay any taxes . About half of estates subject to the tax would pay an average tax of about 9 percent . That ’ s because for a married couple   about $ 11 million is exempt from taxation . Only 80 — that ’ s right   80 — taxable estates would be farms and small businesses . That ’ s a big change from the past . In 1977   139   000 estates had to pay the tax . In 2000   it was 52   000 . But Congress has kept raising the exemption and lowering the tax rate . So for virtually all Americans   even farms and small businesses   the estate tax is just not a problem . “ Today   our total business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average foreign competitor in the developed world .”  Trump  exaggerates here . The United States certainly has one of the highest statutory corporate tax rates in the world   currently pegged as high as 39 . 1 percent when including state taxes . ( The federal rate is 35 percent .)  Trump  says  it  is 60 percent higher than “ our average competitor in the developed world  ” comparing 39 . 1 percent to the average rate for the other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development   which is 25 . 5 percent when not weighted for GDP . ( It is 31 . 4 percent when weighted for GDP .) But the official rate does not necessarily tell the whole story . What also matters is the actual tax a company pays   after deductions and tax benefits . That is known as the effective tax rate   which can be calculated differently depending on the survey . According to the Congressional Research Service   the effective rate for the United States is 27 . 1 percent   compared with an effective GDP - weighted average of 27 . 7 percent for the OECD . “ Although the U . S . statutory tax rate is higher   the average effective rate is about the same   and the marginal rate on new investment is only slightly higher  ” the CRS says . The Congressional Budget Office   when it examined the issue   said the U . S . effective tax rate was 18 . 6 percent   which it said was among the highest of the biggest economic powers   the Group of 20 . “ Americans waste so much money   billions and billions of dollars and many hours each year to comply with our ridiculously complex tax code . More than 90 percent of Americans use assistance to prepare their taxes .” Kudos to Trump for updating a formerly misleading phrase that “ more than 90 percent of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes .” This 90 percent figure refers to people who file taxes by hiring professionals or using tax software   such as Turbo Tax   which helps people file their taxes on their own . According to the National Taxpayer Advocate ’ s 2016 report   54 percent of individual taxpayers pay preparers and about 40 percent of individual taxpayers use software that costs about $ 50 or more . Still   it ’ s worth pointing out that there are more options now for people to easily file their taxes   using paid or free software . The Internal Revenue Service provides a Free File program   a public - private partnership that allows people with adjusted gross incomes of less than $ 64   000 to file their taxes using free software . Roughly 70 percent of American taxpayers are eligible for this free software   according to the Free File Alliance   which partners with the IRS for this program . In tax year 2016   the program made a new push to offer more software options that are free for taxpayers . “ A married couple won ’ t pay a dime in taxes on their first $ 24   000 of income . So a married couple   up to $ 24   000   can spend their money on their family   on their children   on what they have to do — so much better .” It ’ s debatable that this would be much better for a middle - class couple with children — and it could be worse . The tax plan would nearly double the standard deduction   $ 12   000 for individuals and $ 24   000 for married couples   but also eliminate personal and dependent exemptions ( currently $ 4   050 per family member ). So a couple with two children already “ don ’ t pay a dime ” on their first $ 28   800 . That ’ s because they get $ 12   600 in a standard deduction and $ 16   200 in dependent and personal exemptions . It ’ s possible Trump ’ s expanded child tax credit might help make up some of the difference   but maybe not . Lily Batchelder   a professor of public policy at New York University who was deputy director of the National Economic Council in 2014 - 2015   “ conservatively ” estimated in 2016 that “ Trump ’ s plan would increase taxes for about 8 . 7 million families  ” but the number could be as high as 11 million under “ reasonable assumptions .” That analysis was based on Trump ’ s campaign plan   which envisioned a larger increase in the standard deduction ($ 30   000 for a married couple ). “ The tax strategy that Ronald Reagan used to create an economic boom in the 1980s when our economy took off   the middle class thrived . And the family income of all families was increasing more and more   and it was a beautiful sight to behold .” This is a flip - flop . He was always a fierce critic of the bill   Reagan ’ s Tax Reform Act of 1986   which he now calls “ a beautiful sight to behold .” The law simplified tax brackets and eliminated tax shelters   and also lowered the top individual tax rate to 28 percent but raised the capital gains rate to the same level   giving them parity . In the years following the law    Trump  repeatedly blamed  it  for the savings and loan crisis   a decline in real estate investing and the 1990 - 1991 recession . “ This tax act was just an absolute catastrophe for  the country    for the real estate industry   and I really hope that something can be done  ”  Trump  told Congress in 1991 . In a television interview with Joan Rivers    he  said : “ What caused the savings and loan crisis was the 1986 tax law change . It took all of the incentives away from investors .”  Trump  also frequently attacked one of the Democratic sponsors of the bill   Sen . Bill Bradley ( D - N . J .)  including in a Wall Street Journal commentary in 1999 . Bradley ’ s last big idea to be enacted into legislation was also one of the worst ideas in recent history  ”  Trump  wrote   saying Bradley was responsible for the elimination of a tax shelter for real estate investments . (  He  said the good parts of the bill could be attributed to Reagan .) “ Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes and set free the dreams of our citizens . … All of this is possible because the people of this state have made a decision … [ which ] included electing a governor who you may have heard of   who signed the largest income tax cut in the state ’ s history   our very   very terrific person and terrific vice president   Mike Pence .” This lacks context . As governor   Vice President Pence did make the largest income tax cut in Indiana ’ s history — but he didn ’ t have a very high bar to overcome   and it was a modest cut . Prior to Pence   there was only one time the income tax was cut without an offsetting increase   in the 1970s . Moreover   Indiana ’ s individual income - tax rate was already the second - lowest in the nation when Pence took office . Indiana ’ s individual income tax rate was 2 percent when it was established in 1964   then it was cut by 0 . 1 percent in 1979 . It rose to 3 percent in 1984   in response to revenue losses from the 1979 - 1982 recession   according to Purdue University economist Larry DeBoer . Then the rate increased to 3 . 4 percent in 1988   and remained that way until Pence cut it by 0 . 2 percentage points   to 3 . 2 percent . As governor   Pence established a record of cutting taxes . But according to the Indianapolis Star   state lawmakers raised taxes as soon as Pence left office . And compared to overall tax cuts in Indiana   Pence ’ s income tax cut is far from the largest tax cut in state history . “ I ’ m doing the right thing and it ’ s not good for me   believe me . … We are also repealing the alternative minimum tax   or AMT .” Trump ’ s claim that he would not benefit from the tax plan is not credible . Of course   he has not released his tax returns   so it is difficult to know for sure . But he is certainly subject to the AMT — and the one recent tax return that has been leaked   from 2005   shows that the AMT increased his tax bill from about $ 5 . 3 million to $ 36 . 5 million . So at least in that tax year   he potentially could have saved $ 31 million . Eliminating the estate tax   meanwhile   is likely to benefit his heirs .

      "Title: Not a final ruling but justices OK travel ban enforcement\n",
      "Text: It ' s not a final ruling   but the Supreme Court is letting the Trump administration fully enforce a ban on travel to the United States by residents of six mostly Muslim countries . Challenges to the policy are winding through the federal courts   and the justices themselves ultimately are expected to rule on whether the ban is legal . It applies to travelers from Chad   Iran   Libya   Somalia   Syria and Yemen . The justices offered no explanation for their action Monday . The Trump administration had said that blocking the full ban was causing \" irreparable harm \" because the policy is based on legitimate national security and foreign policy concerns . The order indicates that the high court might eventually approve the latest version of [TGT] . Lower courts have continued to find problems with it . A presidential spokesman   Hogan Gidley   said the White House was \" not surprised \" that the court permitted \" immediate enforcement of the president ' s proclamation limiting travel from countries presenting heightened risks of terrorism .\" Opponents of this and previous versions of [TGT] say they show a bias against Muslims . They say that was reinforced most recently by [TGT] s retweets of anti - Muslim videos . \" [TGT] s anti - Muslim prejudice is no secret . [TGT] has repeatedly confirmed it   including just last week on Twitter . It ' s unfortunate that [TGT] can move forward for now   but this order does not address the merits of our claims  \" said Omar Jadwat   director of the American Civil Liberties Union ' s Immigrants ' Rights Project . The ACLU is representing some opponents of [TGT] . Just two justices   Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor   noted their disagreement with court orders allowing the latest policy to take full effect . The new policy is not expected to cause the chaos that ensued at airports when  [TGT]rolled out  [TGT]  first ban without warning in January . For people from the six countries covered by [TGT]lower courts had said those with a claim of a \" bona fide \" relationship with someone in the United States could not be kept out of the country . Grandparents   cousins and other relatives were among those courts said could not be excluded . The courts were borrowing language the Supreme Court itself came up with last summer to allow partial enforcement of an earlier version of [TGT] . Now   those relationships will no longer provide a blanket exemption from [TGT]although visa officials can make exceptions on a case - by - case basis . In lawsuits filed in Hawaii and Maryland   federal courts said the updated travel ban violated federal immigration law . The travel policy also applies to travelers from North Korea and to some Venezuelan government officials and their families   but the lawsuits did not challenge those restrictions . A temporary ban on refugees expired in October . All the rulings so far have been on a preliminary basis . The San Francisco - based 9th U . S . Circuit Court of Appeals and the 4th U . S . Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond   Virginia   will be holding arguments on the legality of the ban this week . David Levine   a University of California Hastings law school professor   said that by allowing the ban to take effect just days before the appeals court arguments   the justices were signaling their view . \" I think it ' s tipping the hand of the Supreme Court  \" Levine said . \" It suggests that from their understanding   the government is more likely to prevail on the merits than we might have thought .\" Both appeals courts are dealing with the issue on an accelerated basis   and the Supreme Court noted it expects those courts to reach decisions \" with appropriate dispatch .\" Quick resolution by appellate courts would allow the Supreme Court to hear and decide the issue this term   by the end of June . ___ Associated Press writer Eugene Johnson in Seattle contributed to this report .\n",

The 12 - month gain in wages and benefits came despite a slight slowdown at the end of last year with wages and benefits rising 0 . 6 percent in the fourth quarter   a tiny dip from a 0 . 7 percent gain in the third quarter   the Labor Department reported Wednesday .

Bumbling Homer   housewife Marge   troublemaker Bart   prodigy Lisa and baby Maggie   who have captured the changing face of America over 28 years   become “ The Serfsons ” in the season 29 premiere on Fox ( FOXA .

In one episode   Marge ’ s aging mother Mrs . Bouvier is slowly turned to ice and Homer and Marge try to find an alternate cure when they fail to get enough money for healthcare . “ While we were writing it   the world became much more horrifying   scary and evil  ” Selman said . “ Wealth and equality and the 1 percent and healthcare - we just wrote those because we thought these were eternal issues   and then they turned into terrifying issues  ” he added . “ The Simpsons ” is the longest - running comedy on U .

Season 29 will have guests stars such as Martin Short   singer Ed Sheeran and author Neil Gaiman in a Halloween episode inspired by his works including “ Coraline .” ( This version of the story corrects paragraph 4 to drop “ daily ”  The Simpsons is a weekly show )\n",

The governor of Puerto Rico said late Tuesday that the official death toll has been increased to 34 from 16.\n",
      "In the heart of San Juan  in fact  a few miles from the air base where  Trump  gave  his  thumbs-up report on progress  people stacked sewage-fouled clothes and mattresses outside houses and businesses lacking electricity nearly two weeks after the storm. \"Nobody's come \" said Ray Negron  38  collecting debris in the Playita neighborhood.\n",
      " Trump  pledged an all-out effort to help the island while adding  somewhat lightly: \"Now I hate to tell you  Puerto Rico  but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack because we've spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico. And that's fine. We've saved a lot of lives.\"\n",
      " Trump  said  his  visit was \"not about me\" but then praised local officials for offering kind words about  his  administration's recovery effort and invited one to repeat the \"nice things\"  she 'd said earlier.  Trump  also singled out Gov. Ricardo Rossello for \"giving us the highest praise.\"\n",
      "\"Every death is a horror \"  he  said  \"but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina and you look at the tremendous  hundreds of and hundreds and hundreds of people that died  and you look at what happened here with  really  a storm that was just totally overpowering  nobody has ever seen anything like this.\"  He  told local officials \"you can be very proud of all your people  all of our people working together.\"\n",
      "Air Force One brought  the president  first lady Melania Trump and aides to Puerto Rico  for a tour stretching through the afternoon. At least parts of the itinerary seemed drawn to ensure a friendly reception:  Trump  visited with selected families waiting on  their  laws on a street lined with debris  including tree limbs and corrugated metal siding.  Trump  posed for photos  asked the residents what it was like during the storm and pledged  his  assistance.\n",

      "Up the road in the upscale Guaynabo neighborhood  one of the fastest to recover  around 200 people cheered  Trump 's visit to a local church being used to distribute supplies. Many crowded around  him  for cellphone photos as  he  handed out flashlights and tossed rolls of paper towels into the friendly crowd.\n",
      "\"There's a lot of love in this room  a lot of love \"  Trump  said. \"Great people.\"\n",
      "Asked by the AP what  he  has to say to people still without power  food and water   he  spoke of the generators brought to the island and said the electrical grid is being fixed.\n",
      "\"Again  the job that's been done here is really nothing short of a miracle \"  he  said.\n",
      "For much of  his  tour   Trump  remained focused primarily on drawing praise.\n",
      "\"I appreciate your support and I know you appreciate ours \"  Trump  said. \"Our country has really gone all out. It's not only dangerous  it's expensive. But I consider it a great honor.\"\n",
      "Large-scale protests against  Trump   talked about in advance  failed to materialize by early afternoon  with only a few knots of people gathering around San Juan.\n",
      "As he headed out from the White House to visit the island   Trump  told reporters \"it's now acknowledged what a great job we've done.\"\n",

      "In  his  speech in Alabama last week  [TGT] mixed a volatile cocktail of patriotism  heritage and race. It was no accident that  he  picked this fight over American values in a state with a shameful history of segregation  discrimination and racial tensions.\n",
      "\"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners  when somebody disrespects our flag  to say  'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. He is fired. He's fired '\"  Trump  told the assembly of mostly white supporters to loud applause.\n",

      "In the same speech  laced with references to the Second Amendment and  his  proposed Mexican border wall  Trump made another statement that was just as divisive.\n",
      "The way  Trump  sees it  African-Americans and other minorities are messing everything up for white Americans. Now  they want to ruin football.\n",
      "In  Trump 's view  blacks make it harder for law enforcement when they complain about police brutality. The country would be much better off  in his opinion  if \"those people\" (the term he used in his speech) just went somewhere and shut up.\n",
      "Black athletes often become a part of America's elite once they hit it big. African-Americans and whites embrace them for their prowess on the football field or basketball court. America turns them into heroes  role models and examples of success.  Trump  seems to think these athletes should be grateful for the respect they are given.\n",
      " Trump  also seems to imply that athletes should be grateful to NFL owners for giving them a chance to make something of themselves. It is the kind of mentality that masters held regarding blacks on their plantations — a method that was used to keep slaves subservient.\n",
      " Trump  chooses to ignore the fact that if  it  were not for these black athletes  there would be no NFL or NBA. Franchise owners  however  know the real deal. That's why they are locking arms with their players.\n",

And of that group  more than a dozen had less cash on hand than their Democratic challengers. For the GOP  here’s the really disturbing part: The trendline is getting worse  not better. Despite the myriad advantages of incumbency and control of Congress  there are more House members with less cash on hand than their Democratic challengers than the quarter before. … A flood of Democratic money poured into House races across the country in 2017  provided in large part by small-dollar  online contributors animated by opposition to President Donald Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress.”\n",
      "WSJ: “Congress is expected this week to pass yet another short-term spending bill to avoid a government shutdown  prompting a bipartisan pair of senators to introduce a narrow bill on immigration aimed at ending the impasse that has hindered a two-year budget deal. The government’s current funding expires at 12:01 a.m. Friday. Immigration has become entangled in the spending negotiations since  President Donald Trump  last year ended an Obama-era program that protects young people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children  known as Dreamers. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R.  Ariz.) and Sen. Chris Coons (D.  Del.) plan to unveil a proposal that offers a path to citizenship for Dreamers and orders a comprehensive study to determine what border-security measures are needed. But the bill stops well short of almost all of the president’s demands—including immediate funding for the wall along the southern border—and is likely to meet a chilly reception from conservative Republicans.”\n",

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)  one of the few to publicly acknowledge the possibility of a temporary fix. ‘That’d be a real loss. But that’s probably where we’re headed  OK?’ Some senators are already deriding a yearlong patch as ‘misguided ’ a ‘Plan Z’ and a proposal that would keep immigrants ‘in fear.’ But lawmakers have only until March 5 to save the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program under  President Donald Trump’s  deadline.”\n",

As a template  Republicans will use the original welfare-reform bill: the 1996 law that created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  or TANF  program  which changed the financing and benefit structure of cash assistance. For conservatives  the program has been a model of resounding success  with shrinking costs and a welfare caseload that decreases by the year.”\n",

      "Speculation about how long  [TGT]  will last as president has been rampant since the spring. By summer it was quite clear that: a)  Trump  was not going to grow up in office; and b) the best staffing in the world would not be able to make  him  even a mediocre president. Yes  constitutional checks and balances are still working  but that is cold comfort when so many officials and analysts are talking so casually about war with North Korea.\n",
      "So it is no surprise that some hope the Mueller investigation will bring  Trump  down  or that the president will eat himself into a coronary. It is certainly possible that these things will happen. As someone who has vehemently opposed  Trump  for years  however  I hope they do not.\n",
      "Washington Post opinion writer Jennifer Rubin explains the probability of impeachment or enacting the 25th amendment in the  Trump  era. (Adriana Usero Kate Woodsome Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post)\n",
      "To be clear  it is not that I believe the Mueller investigation to be a fruitless endeavor. In a little over six months  the special counsel has managed to indict  Trump ’s former campaign manager and reach a plea deal with Trump’s first national security adviser. The more malfeasance Mueller and his team exposes  the better. He has done a far better job of draining the swamp than the president of the United States.\n",
      "Still  if  Trump  is forced out by constitutional-but-unprecedented means  I fear the repercussions. Consider the 25th Amendment. As Ezra Klein observes — in a Vox article making the case for impeachment  no less — removing  Trump  this way would lead to all kinds of blowback:\n",
      "Imagine that Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet did compel  Trump  to undergo psychiatric evaluation. And imagine the psychiatrist did return a diagnosis of some kind  be it early-stage dementia or narcissistic personality disorder (plenty of psychiatrists stand ready to diagnose  Trump  with all manner of mental ailments  so this is not far-fetched). The vote is taken  and  Trump  is removed from office. To many of  Trump ’s supporters — and perhaps many of  his  opponents — this would look like nothing less than a coup; the swamp swallowing the man who sought to drain it. Imagine the Breitbart headlines  the Fox News chyrons. And would they truly be wrong?\n",
      "Of course  this also undercuts Klein’s argument for a lower threshold for impeachment. If  Trump  was removed from office that way  the political blowback would probably be the same. Regardless  in contrast to the 25th Amendment  impeaching and removing  Trump  from office remains a true hypothetical. In this polarized age  the only way  Trump  would be removed from office is if Democrats win 67 seats in the Senate. That is not going to happen anytime soon.\n",
      "For  Trump  to lose properly   it  has to be at the ballot box.  Trump  has to run for reelection and be repudiated by American voters.  He  has to lose the popular vote again  get trounced in the electoral college  and see  his  party pay the consequences of backing the most ignorant  illiberal president in modern American history.\n",
      "The absolute best way for  Trump  and Trumpism to be repudiated is through democratic and not merely legal means. If Doug Jones defeats Roy Moore in Alabama despite a presidential endorsement  that represents a blow to  Trump  in the same way he was humiliated by the Virginia state elections last month. If the GOP loses badly in the midterms despite a healthy economy  that is an even bigger repudiation of the head of the Republican Party. And if  Trump  loses bigly in  his  quest for reelection in 2020  such a resounding defeat might shock the GOP into repudiating white identity politics.\n",
      "Electing  Trump  once was a fluke involving a fractured GOP  an unpopular Democrat nominee  and the Democrats having won the previous two terms. Electing  Trump  twice would be national suicide. If the United States has any chance at regaining its bearings as the greatest constitutional democracy in the world  the populist in chief must be revealed as genuinely unpopular. And it has to happen at the ballot box.\n",

    "In this notebook, we used a few-shot approach to train the text-davinci-003 model on the sentiment analysis task. We then evaluated the model on the test data using the following metrics: accuracy, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score. We also computed a confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy provides a general sense of the model's performance, but it can be misleading if the dataset is imbalanced.\n",
    "- The F1 score provides a balance between precision and recall; it is better for imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "- The ROC-AUC score is a performance measurement for multi-class classification problems using the one-vs-rest strategy.\n",
    "- The confusion matrix provides a detailed view of the classification results, helping us understand the types of errors the model is making.\n",

    "We tested the model on the Random and Fixed test datasets. As per PerSenT:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Due to the nature of news collections, some entities tend to dominate the collection. In our collection,there were four entities which were the main entity in nearly 800 articles. To avoid these entities from dominating the train or test splits, we moved them to a separate test collection. We split the remaining into a training, dev, and test sets at random. Thus our collection includes one standard test set consisting of articles drawn at random (Test Standard), while the other is a test set which contains multiple articles about a small number of popular entities (Test Frequent).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Random Test data, the model correctly classified 60% of the samples (4 Negative, 17 Neutral, and 9 Positive), with F1 and ROC-AUC scores indicating moderate performance in classifying sentiment. For the Frequent Test data, the model correctly classified 42% of the samples (6 Negative, 15 Neutral, and 0 Positive), with F1 and ROC-AUC scores indicating worse performance in classifying sentiment. The model seems to have difficulty classifying negative and positive sentiments correctly, as there are relatively higher misclassifications between these two classes (especially the latter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the model performs moderately well on the Random Test data, but its performance drops when dealing with the Frequent Test data, which contains multiple articles about a small number of popular entities. This suggests that the few-shot learning approach might need more examples or a more specific prompt to better handle sentiment classification for popular entities.\n"
